	<h3><span style="background-color: #C0C0C0">Content Download</span></h3>
	<p><b>Description: </b>Customer downloads content (redeems
		      eTicket) into his player's BB Card.</p>
	<p><b>Rationale</b></p>
	<ol>
	  <li>Customer may own a large number of eTickets, but have space for a limited
	    number of content on his BB Card. So, he may constantly be deleting and
	    reloading content into the BB Card from his virtual <i>Safety Box.</i></li>
	  <li>Content download is a separate action from <i>
	    eTicket Purchase</i>, since this may take a
	    slightly longer period of time.</li>
	  <li>By downloading the content of a game,
	    the customer agrees that the
	    corresponding eTicket is no longer refundable.
	  </li>
	</ol>
	<p><b>Assumptions &amp; conditions</b></p>
	<ol>
	  <li>The BB Card identifies (does not authenticate) the BB Player for which the
	    eTicket has been. The actual BB Player does not need to be present.</li>
	  <li>The BB Player owns at least one eTicket which identifies the content.</li>
	  <li>In order to complete download of the initial <i>Free Content</i> associated
        with the purchase of a BB Player, the customer has to open the packaging
        and retrieve the BB Card.</li>
	  <li>Retailer does not have to authenticate the depot the server.</li>
	</ol>
