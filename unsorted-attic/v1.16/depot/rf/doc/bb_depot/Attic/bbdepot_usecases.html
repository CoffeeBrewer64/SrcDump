      <p><b>Rationale</b></p>
      <ol>
	<li>Customer may own a large number of eTickets, but have
	  space for a limited number of content on his BB Card. So, he
	  may constantly be deleting and reloading content into the BB

	<li>Content download is a separate action from <i> eTicket
	    Purchase</i>, since this may take a slightly longer period
	  of time.</li> 
	<li>By downloading the content of a game, the customer agrees
	  that the corresponding eTicket is no longer refundable. 
	</li>
      </ol>
      <p><b>Assumptions &amp; conditions</b></p>
      <ol>
	<li>The BB Card identifies (does not authenticate) the BB
	  Player for which the eTicket has been. The actual BB Player
	  does not need to be present.</li> 
	<li>The BB Player owns at least one eTicket which identifies
	  the content.</li>
	<li>In order to complete download of the initial <i>Free
	    Content</i> associated with the purchase of a BB Player,
	  the customer has to open the packaging and retrieve the BB
	  Card.</li> 
	<li>Retailer may have to authenticate the depot the server
