        <li>BB Safety Box - When a customer has rights to content, either
          through the purchase of an eTicket or by getting <i>Free Content</i>,
          his content is kept in a <i>Safety Box</i> on the Server. The customer
          is told that &quot;your purchased content is securely preserved in <i>Safety
          Box </i>from where you can always download it at no cost&quot;.</li>
