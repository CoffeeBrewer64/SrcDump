        <p><b>Description: </b>Customer selects and "pays" for a piece of content, and upon successful
      completion, owns the content for playing on his BB Player.</p>
	<p><b>Rationale</b></p>
	<ol>
	  <li>eTicket i.e. content license is individualized for the BB Player. Possession of
        the content alone does not indicate ownership.&nbsp;</li>
	</ol>
	<p><b>Requirements</b></p>
      <ol>
        <li>Customer must be able to identify the BB Card that belongs to him
          via some visible mark without plugging in the card. In addition
          customer may be permitted to enter some personalization information
          that is stored in the BB Card and viewable by the BB Player or BB
          Depot.</li>
          <li>Customer has previously selected the content that he wishes to purchase and has a Game Card of the appropriate value to purchase that content.</li>
      </ol>
	<p><b>Assumptions &amp; conditions</b></p>
	<ol>
	  <li>Customer has purchased a BB Player and he has an individualized BB Card
        for his BB Player. Customer is responsible for ensuring that he does not
        bring in the BB Card belonging to some other BB Player.</li>
	  <li>The BB Card has a BBID that uniquely identifies (does not authenticate) the BB Player for which the eTicket will be issued.</li>
	  <li>Customer does not have to bring in his BB Player.</li>

      <p><b>Description: </b>Customer backs up content to Safety Box .</p>
	<p><b>Rationale</b></p>
	<ol>
	  <li>Customer will be prompted only
	    when he wants to download a piece of content (either a new purchase or a restoration from their Safety Box) and the BB Card does not
        have enough free space for downloading that content.</li>
	</ol>

	<p><b>Requirements</b></p>
      <ol>
        <li>Memory capacity and management must be easily understandable by the
          customer, who may have very little computer
          knowledge. The customer base includes small children who have limited
          comprehension of large numbers.</li>
      </ol>

        <p><b>Description: </b>Customer downloads content (which he already has an eTicket for) onto his BB Card.</p>
	<p><b>Rationale</b></p>
	<ol>
	  <li>Customer may own a large number of eTickets, but have space for a limited
	    number of pieces of content on his BB Card. So, he may constantly be backing up and
        restoring content onto the BB Card from his virtual <i>Safety Box.</i></li>
	</ol>
	<p><b>Requirements</b></p>
      <ol>
        <li>It must be possible to automatically download promotional content as
          part of regular content downloads if space is available. Customer must
          not have to manage space used by promotional content.</li>
      </ol>
	<p><b>Assumptions &amp; conditions</b></p>
	<ol>
	  <li>The BB Card identifies (does not authenticate) the BB Player for which the
	    eTicket has been purchased. The actual BB Player does not need to be present.</li>
