      <h3>I. Motivation</h3>
      <p>
	The old model has several problems that we need to solve:
	<ol>
	  <li>There is no practical way to revoke a eTicket.  It is
	    unacceptable not to refund the customer if a
	    wrong eTicket is issued because of operator error.
	  </li>
	  <li>One way avoid this problem is to shift the
	    responsibility to the customer.  That is, we require the
	    customer to verify the eTicket title and give explicit 
	    confirmation before the transaction is processed. However,
	    this requires extra hardware (e.g., an extra display and
	    keypad) on the BB Depot.</li>
	  <li>Instead of providing extra hardware, we could overload
	    the download station to be used for confirmation of
	    purchases.  But this requires exclusive access to the
	    download station during the entire purchasing process.</li>
	</ol>
      <h3>II. The New Model</h3>
      <p>
	The key idea is to decouple customer payment from the
	actual processing of the eTickets.  From the customer's point
	of view, it takes the following steps to purchase a eTicket:
	<ol>
	  <li>customer selects a game title</li>
	  <li>customer pays for the selected game, and hands over his BB Card to the shop owner</li>
	  <li>shop owner registers a <em>store credit</em> for the
	    selected game with the BB as identified by the BB Card, and
	    returns the BB Card to the customer</li>
	  <li>customer walks over to the download station, inserts the BB Card, and selects from a menu on the display for eTicket
	    purchases.</li>
	  <li>the display shows all the titles associated with this BB
	    for which it has store credit.</li>
	  <li>customer selects the eTicket that he wants to download,
	    confirm the selection, and
	    removes the BB Card when the transaction is
	    complete.  </li>
	</ol>
      <p>
	Note that once a eTicket is downloaded, it cannot be revoked.
	However, in the new model the customer is given a chance to
	confirm the purchase.  As long as the eTicket has not been
	downloaded, he could go back to the shop owner and switch his
	store credits for another game within a certain prescribed time limit. 
      </p>
      <h3>III. Store Credits</h3>
      <p>
	Store Credits (SC) is a new concept that requires some
	explanation.  It is a record in our server database that contains:
	<ol>
	  <li>BB ID</li>
	  <li>Depot ID</li>
	  <li>cash value</li>
	  <li>content ID</li>
	</ol>
	When a customer purchases a game via a particular BB Depot, an
	SC record is created in the server's database.  It is a token
	that binds the BB and the Depot with the specified content.  When
	the customer redeems the SC for an eTicket, it will be issued
	for that particular BB and that particular content only.&nbsp;
      <p>The BB Card by itself is <strong>not</strong> a
	secure device (i.e., it could be cloned) and there is no guarantee that
	its content cannot be duplicated. The BB Card is used to identify the BB
      Player (which is a secure device). This creates two risks</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A malicious user may clone the BB Card and get a refund for the SC</li>
        <li>A malicious user may redeem the eTicket forcing the issuance of an
          eTicket and denying the customer from seeking a refund if he so
          desires. This eTicket, while useless to the malicious user may cause
          the victim to own content which he otherwise may not have wanted.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>To guard against the above two risks, a SC is automatically marked as
      redeemed once a certain time limit has passed. Therefore any refund
      request will have to be made quickly by the customer while he is still in
      the store. A refund is allowed provided the refund request is issued from the
	same BB Depot shown in the SC record, and the corresponding
	eTicket has not been redeemed.  The original shop that creates
	the SC record <em>owns</em> the sale, and it is the only shop
	that is authorized to issue refund. In addition, this <em>"while the customer is in store"</em> refund policy
      will ensure that the refund is not claimed by a malicious user, since it
      will be hard to
	pretend to be the victim while he is still in the store.&nbsp;</p>


      <h3>IV. Security Analysis</h3>
      <p>
	Given that the BB Card carried by a customer is
	<strong>not</strong> a secure device, there is no guarantee that
	its content cannot be duplicated.  As a result, it is possible
	to steal the identity of a BB owner by cloning his BB Card.  We decided to trade off this security risk for user
	convenience.
      </p>
      <p>
	It is still possible to minimize the security risk.  
	Limiting the time where refund and exchange can be made
	substantially reduces the window of opportunity for an
	identity thief.  In fact, most customers are expected to
	finish a purchase transaction within a few minutes.
      </p>
      <p>
	Another way to reduce the vulnerability is to include a sequence
	number with the BB ID (with proper encryption, digital
	signature, etc.).  This sequence number is incremented every
	time the BB Card is plugged in back to the BB
	controller.  To authenticate a user, the server checks that
	the sequence number is greater than or equal to the one use in
	the last transaction.  This scheme does not fully authenticate
	a customer, but at least invalidates the stolen identity upon
	the real owner's next visit.
