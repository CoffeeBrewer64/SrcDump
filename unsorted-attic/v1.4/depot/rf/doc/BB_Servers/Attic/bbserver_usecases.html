  <li>Purchase transactions need to be recorded to the server  in real time<b></b>
  <li>RetailerÅfs involvement needs to be  minimized<b></b>

  <li>Title content had been downloaded into BB Depot
  <li>Internet connection is up
  </ul>

<dt><p><b>Participants:</b>

  <dd>Customer, Retailer, BB, BB Depot, eTicket Server,  eTicket DB

<dt><p><b>Point of  control</b>:

  <dd>BB Depot 

<dt><p><b>Sequence of events</b>:

  <ol>
  <li>Customer tells Retailer a title to purchase
  <li>Customer attaches the BB Memory Module to the designated port of BB Depot
  for an eTicket purchase process. BB Depot will detect the BB  automatically and
  reads its BB ID.
  The port will be located near by BB Depot Console so that Retailer can make
  sure appropriate BB is attached to the  port.
  <li>Retailer interacts with BB Depot Console to enter which port to use and
  what title to sell
  <li>BB Depot sends an eTicket issue request to the  eTicket server.
  It will send: BB Depot ID, BB ID, and Title ID.
  This will  effectively involve the eTicket server into
  the distributed transaction.  
  <li>eTicket server generates new eTicket for the BB/Title, and  sends it
  back to the BB Memory Module via the BB Depot
  <li>If one of the above  fails, BB Depot rolls back the transaction.
  Both BB Memory Module and eTicket server will also need to rollback
  whenever the connection to the session gets  terminated.
  <li>BB Depot console and  BB indicate the completion to Retailer and Customer
  <li>Customer detach the  BB Memory Module
  <li>BB Depot automatically detects the disconnection of the BB Memory Module
  </ol>
