      <h3><a name="Restore"><span style="background-color: #C0C0C0">Content Restore from Safety Box</span></a></h3>
        <p><b>Description: </b>Customer downloads content (which he already has an eTicket for) onto his BB Card.</p>
	<p><b>Rationale</b></p>
	<ol>
	  <li>Customer may own a large number of eTickets, but have space for a limited
	    number of pieces of content on his BB Card. So, he may constantly be backing up and
        restoring content onto the BB Card from his virtual <i>Safety Box.</i></li>
	</ol>
	<p><b>Requirements</b></p>
      <ol>
        <li>It must be possible to automatically download promotional content as
          part of regular content downloads if space is available. Customer must
          not have to manage space used by promotional content.</li>
      </ol>
	<p><b>Assumptions &amp; conditions</b></p>
	<ol>
	  <li>The BB Card identifies (does not authenticate) the BB Player for which the
	    eTicket has been purchased. The actual BB Player does not need to be present.</li>
	  <li>The BB Player owns at least one eTicket which identifies the content.</li>
