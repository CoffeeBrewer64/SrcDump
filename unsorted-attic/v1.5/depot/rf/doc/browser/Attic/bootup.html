  <li> Recovery: <br>
    Recovery is needed when the SK or first app (i.e., BA) on the flash has
    become damaged and unusable. The memory card is brought to the depot.
    Current thinking is the depot will have a special slot for memory cards
    that is used for both license purchase and recovery. The Boot-ROM loads
    the SK, so it must be able to detect the SK is bad and provide the
    appropriate alert (LED or message to screen).
    
    <p>
    In the unlikely case we decide to be extremely paranoid, and assume the SK
    could go bad simultaneously with a block holding whatever authentication
    data is requried to authenticate the memory module a the depot, the bootRom
    must be capable of writing a "recovery packet" to the first good block.
    This packet will likely contain (i) BBID (plaintext); (ii)
    Encrypt_with_BB_priv_key(hash(BBID + <constant string>)), where constant
    string is agreed upon before manufacture.  The recovery server will then
    re-intiialize the FS and place the SK, BA and certificate in external flash
    according to the FS.

  <li> Power-on detects no flash: <br>
       Must write informative message to the tv.

<b>Potential Secure Kernel Tasks:</b>
a143 6
The tasks listed below are those that will require support from the secure
kernel. This list is intended to itemize the work to be done, and not to
suggest an optimal ordering for implementation. The sections to follow will
address those issues, address the work distribution between the broswer
application and secure kernel (secure SRAM), and provide another level of
detail for task steps.

  <li> Activation: <br>
    We don't know yet exactly when activation steps will occur (factory, depot,
    ...). Prior to activation: 
    <ul>
      <li> the secure kernel must be present in external flash, occupying
         the first good blocks (fixed size, so number blocks can be fixed).
      <li> the BA must follow the SK on the next sequence of good blocks.
      <li> the BB certificate, signed appropriately, must be in external flash.
      <li> the flash file system <i>should</i> be initialized.
    </ul>
    The activation step will then occur at the depot. The details are still
    being worked out.

  <li> Recovery: <br>
    The same text as in the "Boot-Rom Tasks" section apply here as well.
    The SK must detect if the BA is bad and write the same recovery packet.

  <li> Content Download: <br>
    Most of the processing required to download content will occur in the
    browser. However, authentication will be required. Pending definition of the
    content download protocol, this is likely to include:
    <ul> 
      <li> a step dependent on the SK. This step is to authenticate the BB 
        conducting the transaction. The depot BB conducting the transaction
        may be required to authenticate itself using a challenge-response
	scheme.
      <li> a step that does not depend on the SK. This step is to authenticate 
        the BB that will play the content. A BB certificate resides 
	on disk from manufacturing or recovery, and all the browser needs to do
	is locate this certificate on disk and pass it along. 
    </ul>

  <li> Content Re-encryption<a href=#footnote3><SUP>3</SUP></a>: <br>
       This is required before running an application (other than the first app
       which is written during activation) acuired at the depot: the flash has
       been removed, new content has been written (at the depot), and flash is
       re-inserted. The re-encryption will occur just before the first attempt
       to run the application.  Details for some of the steps below are given
       in <a href=security/proposal_chip_security.htm>this</a> 
       document. <br>
    <ul>
      <li> Locate and load license information from flash.
      <li> use SFlash reference to external flash re-encryption key table to 
	   see if there is an entry for this CID (assume there is not).
      <li> Use the re-encryption data from the license to create a key.
      <li> In place, a flash block should be re-encrypted using the new
           key. As re-encryption proceeds the hash should be cumulatively
	   computed.
      <li> verify computed hash versus the one in the license over entire
           content.
      <li> write the CID/key pair to external flash table.

The SK must know enough about the <a href=../ffs/ffs.htm>flash file system</a>
to locate the BA (first application) content. The first app content could be
located using steps similar to those for finding the license. This is not
necessary, however, since the first app blocks will always be located in
sequence within the first good blocks of permanent storage. The number of
blocks to load can be determined from the license data. The good block start
offset (i.e., not counting bad blocks) is the fixed number of blocks dedicated
to the SK. To determine if a block is good or bad, the SK can read the
16-byte spare area and check the appropriate byte.

    The license for the first app will most likely not be encrypted using
    this BB's public key, as all other licenses will be. It could be in the
    clear, or encrypted with some other TBD global key that all BBs share.

    These steps must actually be performed such that power loss cannot result
    in content loss.  Also, in the event a block goes bad, there needs to be a
    good amount of flash FS code to handle the content reshuffle. This portion
    of code should reside outside the SK.
