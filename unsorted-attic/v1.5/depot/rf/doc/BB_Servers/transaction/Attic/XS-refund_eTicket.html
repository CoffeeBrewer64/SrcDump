      <h3>Participants</h3>
      <ul>
	<li><strong>BB Depot - Retail App</strong> (<em>point of control</em>)</li>
	<li>Transaction - eTicket Server</li>

      </ul>

      <h3>Requirements</h3>
      <ul>
	<li>Communication between the Depot and the Server is secure.</li>
	<li>The Depot and the Server must authenticate either
	  other.</li>
	<li>Time taken by the BB Activation Server to respond should
	  be minimized.</li>
	<li>Maintain stable state, i.e., transaction either succeeds
	  or fails but never lost.</li>
      </ul>
	  
      <h3>Pre-conditions</h3>
      <ol>
	<li>The BB Depot has the Depot ID inserted.</li>
	<li>The contentID corresponding to the eTicket has been input
	  to the <em>Retail App</em>.</li>
	<li>The BB Card has been inserted into the memory card port of
	  the Depot.</li>
	<li>The BB Player has been activated.</li>
	<li>The BB Card has been individualized.</li>
	<li>The BB Player owns but has not redeemed the eTicket, and
	  the purchase time is less than the refund time limit.</li>
	<li>The BB Depot belongs to the same store that sold the eTicket.</li>
	<li>Network connection between Depot and Server is up and running.</li>
      </ol>
      
      <h3>Input parameters</h3>
      <ol>
	<li><code>BB_ID</code></li>
	<li><code>DepotID</code></li>
	<li><code>Content_ID</code></li>
      </ol>
      
      <h3>Data records</h3>
      <ol>
	<li><a href="../data_defs.html#bb_rec">Transaction - BB Record</a></li>
	<li><a href="../data_defs.html#eticket">Transaction - eTicket Record</a></li>
	<li><a href="../data_defs.html#trans_info">Transaction - Transaction Record</a></li>

      </ol>

      <h3>Output parameters</h3>
      <ol>
	<li><code>status</code></li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Sequence of events</h3>
      <ol>
	<li><code>readID</code>
	  <ol type=a>
	    <li><em>Retail App</em> reads from the <em>BB Card</em>
	      its <code>BB_ID</code></li>
	  </ol>
	</li>
	<li><code>authenticate</code>
	  <ol type=a>
	    <li><em>Retail App</em> connects to <em>eTicket Server</em></li>
	    <li>mutually verifies each other's identity</li>
	    <li>establishes secure communication link</li>
	  </ol>
	</li>
	<li><code>returnTicket</code>
	  <ol type=a>
	    <li><em>Retail App</em> requests for an eTicket refund, passing
	      along the <code>BB_ID</code> and the
	      <code>Content_ID</code> (The <code>DepotID</code>
	      has already passed to the Server as a side-effect of the
	      authentication step.)</li> 
	    <li><em>eTicket Server</em> approves the refund:
	      <ol type=i>
		<li>reads from the BB Record that the BB Player has
		  been activated.</li>
		<li>reads from the eTicket Record that the BB does own
		  an eTicket for that content, and satisfies the
		  condition for a refund.</li>
		<li>reads from the Transaction Record and verifies
		  that the eTicket was sold through the same store,
		  and also notes the purchase amount.</li>
	      </ol>
	    </li>
	    <li><em>eTicket Server</em> updates the database:
	      <ol type=i>
		<li>set the <code>state</code> field of the eTicket
		  Record to <code>returned</code>.</li>
		<li>generates a corresponding Transaction Record.
		  In particular, records the <code>DepotID</code>
		  and the amount we refund to the store's
		  account.</li>
		<li>updates the balance in the Depot Record</li>
	      </ol>
	      The refund is considered complete when all three
	      records are saved in the database.  The above
	      operation must be atomic. 
	    </li>
	    <li><em>eTicket Server</em> returns "success" status
	      to the <em>Retail App</em>.
	    </li>
	  </ol>
	  <strong>Note:</strong> The balance of a Depot is
	  synchronized with the <em>Billing/Account Management</em>
	  system periodically (probably daily) and thus might not
	  reflect the true balance at the time of sale.
	</li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Post-conditions</h3>
      <ol>
	<li>The eTicket Record is marked <em>returned</em>
	  and a Transaction Record is created indicating the refund.</li>
	<li>The balance of the Depot is updated.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Audit Records</h3>
      <ol>
	<li>Refund eTicket  Request - <code>DepotID</code>,
	  <code>BB_ID</code>, <code>Content_ID</code>,
	  <code>date</code>, approval status.</li>
      </ol>
	  
      <h3>Exceptions</h3>

      <ol>
	<li><code>BB_ID</code> cannot be read from <em>BB Card</em> --
	  the BB Card might be uninitialized or broken.</li>
	<li>Secure connection cannot be established - the <em>Retail
	    App</em> needs to provide reason(s) of failure.</li>
	<li>The purchase request is not approved:
	  <ol type=a>
	    <li><code>BB_ID</code> not activated, or it has been
	      suspended or retired.</li>
	    <li>The BB Depot is black listed.</li>
	    <li>The BB does not own such an eTicket.</li>
	    <li>The refund criteria are not matched.</li>
 	    <li>Internal server error, e.g., database failure, backend
	      server crashed, etc.</li>
	  </ol>
	</li>
	<li>If the eTicket is marked <em>free</em>, the refund amount
	  would be zero and the refund condition could be different
	  (e.g., the time limit will be that of the BB Player refund
	  policy instead).
	  </li>
      </ol>
