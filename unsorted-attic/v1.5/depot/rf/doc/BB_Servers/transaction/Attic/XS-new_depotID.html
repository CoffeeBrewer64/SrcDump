      </ol>

      <h3>Sequence of events</h3>
      <ol>
	<li><code>genDepotID</code>
	  <ol type=a>
	    <li><em>Customer Support App</em> pulls out account
	      information corresponding to this retailer, in
	      particular, the storeID with which this DepotID will
	      associate.</li> 
	    <li>A new, unique Depot identity number is generated, and
	      is bound to the given retailer's account.</li>
	  </ol>
	</li>
	<li><code>initDepotID</code>
	  <ol type=a>
	    <li><em>Customer Support App</em> gets a new secure USB
	      token to initialize itself.</li>
	    <li>The token generates a public, private key pair,
	      and send the public key to the <em>Customer Support
		App</em>.
	    </li>
	    <li><em>Customer Support App</em> generates a digital
	      certificate based on the public key and DepotID value,
	      and stores this cert into token (which from now on, is
	      referred to as <em>DepotID</em>).
	    </li>
	    <li>The root cert and CA chain are also stored into the token.</li>
	  </ol>
	  Note: to minimize customer support efforts, no password is
	  set for the token.
	</li>
	<li><code>storeChksum</code>
	  <ol type=a>
	    <li><em>Customer Support App</em> stores the binding of
	      the DepotID with the storeID, as well as a MD5 checksum
	      of its digital certificate to the database.</li>
	  </ol>
	</li>
	<li><code>addDepotID</code>
	  <ol type=a>
	    <li><em>Customer Support App</em> sends the newly created
	      DepotID, the storeID, and the MD5 checksum to the
	      <em>Installer Server</em>.  This is a deferred transaction.
	    </li>
	    <li><em>Installer Server</em> records this binding
	      relationship between the DepotID and storeID into the
	      transaction database.  This information will eventually
	      be propagated to the regional server.
	    </li>
