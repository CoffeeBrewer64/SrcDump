	<p><b>Description: </b>Customer returns a recently purchased BB Player.</p>

	    the stock in case of any erroneous purchases.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>&nbsp;<b>Assumptions &amp; conditions</b></p>
	<ol>
	  <li>After a BB Player has been purchased, a customer has up to 30 minutes during which
	    it may be returned for a refund. This forces the customer to learn our
	    process right away by following through with the content download soon after
	    purchase and limits inventory accounting issues if returns were not subject
	    to a time limit.</li>
	  <li>Returns will also not be permitted if the eTicket
	    associated with the free content is downloaded from
	    the servers or eTickets associated with any other content is downloaded to the BB.</li>
	  <li> <strong>What we really tell the
	      customers</strong> should be that once they've
	    opened the box and used the BB Card, or if they have
	    left the store, they cannot return it.</li>
