<h3>3. <a name="Design Goals"> Design Goals</a></h3>

The following design goals are set for the BB Server architecture:
 <ol>
<li><b>Build secure infrastructure</b><br>
  Though the eventual goal is to build generic secure infrastructure, the
  initial BB System
   is primary focused on a first milestone - securely deliver content from
   developers to BB devices, and securely issue eTickets to BB devices. BB system will be developed with generalization in mind, but
   it is second priority at this point.<li><b>Covers the four functionality categories:</b>
   <ol>
   <li><i>Remote Management of BB Depot</i><br>
       Based on BroadOn RMS server
   <li><i>Secure Content Delivery</i><br>
       From developers who develops <a href="#content">content</a> to BB devices
   <li><i>Secure eTicket issuing</i><br>
       eTicket delivery to BB devices, which spans up to management of
	   BB manufacturing for secure keys. 
   <li><i>BB-Depot account management</i><br>
       Sales support, billing, inventory control, and activity monitoring for
	   retailers who own and operate BB-Depot
   </ol>
   
  <li><b>Componentization</b><br>
    The system is composed of components which are a set of functionality groupings,
    each with a clear role. This will make the entire system more
	flexible and makes it easier to modify or replace a component without
	changing others.&nbsp;<li><b>Minimize state to manage across servers and components</b><br>
    Any state that needs management makes it difficult to componentize the system,
	and it is preferable to have no state dependency amongst servers and
	components so that they can operate independently.<li><b>Use deferred
    transactions/operations wherever possible</b><br>
    The reason is, 1) able to achieve better real time operation performance by
    delaying (or excluding) operations that need no real time response, and 2) makes
	it easier to distribute system.<br>
	Refer to the <a href="#differed_op">"Platforms" section below</a> for
	technologies to implement the differed operations.<li><b>Internationalization
    (I18N) &amp; Localization (L10N)</b><br>
    All user interfaces should be internationalized so that they may be
    subsequently localized for locales with multi-byte characters.
 </ol>

<h3>4. Platforms</h3>

<h4>4.1 Hosting Platform</h4>

The following platform will be supported as the host operating system:
  <ul>
   <li>Sun Solaris 8 and above
   <li>Linux 2.4 and above
  </ul>

<h4>4.2 Database Platform</h4>

There are two types of candidates:
  <ul>
   <li>Production DBMS: Oracle 9i, IBM DB2
   <li>Open source DBMS: MySQL, PostgreSQL
  </ul>

<h4>4.3 Programming Environment</h4>

For the interoperability and platform compatibility (host machines and
databases), Java language environment is preferable. Java is also preferable
because of the availability of wide variety of APIs including database
connections, data manipulations, message queuing, web integration, networking,
etc. Besides, the server infrastructure that BroadOn has developed are
all in Java and several components are re-usable.
 <p>
However, Java lags in the support of secure protocols and algorithms,
and has higher CPU resource consumption compared to C/C++. Therefore,
some security packages/components/servers are needed to be written in C/C++.
There is JNI (Java Native Interface) that can be used to integrate
C/C++ library into Java classes. However JNI has a well known security
hole. Any APIs in JNI libraries can be accessed by anybody without
any authentication. Therefore, Design of JNI library API needs extra
security mechanism to access to security related functionality in the
library. For highest security level, any servers using security
functionality in C/C++ should be developed in C/C++.</p>

<h4>4.4 Technology for Deferred Operations</h4>

<a name="differed_op">
 There are several technologies to implement differed operations:
 <ul>
  <li>Oracle oriented mechanisms
    <ul>
      <li>
	  Snapshot</li>
      <li>DBMS queue</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
	  <li>MOM (Message Oriented Middleware)
        <ul>
          <li>IBM WebSphere MQ</li>
          <li>OpenJMS</li>
          <li>Microsoft Message Queue Server</li>
          <li>Talarian SmartSockets<br>
          </li>
        </ul>
 </ul>
 </a>
	
<a name="assumptions">
<h3>5. Guidelines &amp; Assumptions</h3>

<ol>
  <li><b>Type of </a> <a href="#retailer">retailers</a></b><br>
     Expectation of little knowledge of computer operations, most likely
	 be able to type only numeric keys. They probably run a small shop
	 (a size of 7-eleven store) to sell goods and toys.
  <li><b>Type of <a href="#bb">BB</a> owners</b><br>
    Typically this will include small children with little knowledge of computer
    operations.
  <a name="region_def">
  <li><b>Size of </a> <a href="#region">region</a></b><br>
     A region is a size of one city with 5 to 15 millions of population.
  <li><b>A number of sets of <a href="#regional_servers">regional servers</a> per
         <a href="#region">region</a></b><br>
     There will be one set of regional servers per region.
  <li><b>Target number of <a href="#bbdepot">BB Depots</a> to be deployed</b><br>
     Target is to deploy one BB Depot per 2000 BB devices, and 200 BB Depots
	 per region.
  <li><b>Size of <a href="#content">content</a></b><br>
     32 megabytes + a size of metadata (several hundreds kilobytes) at maximum.
	 A number of titles will be around 500 for next few years.
  <li>The server complex will have a commercial database which can support the
    full range of transactions, crash recovery etc.
  <li>The BB Depot will not persist any information of importance. All
    transaction related information must be persisted on the server side. One
    must assume we must be able to completely recover all secure transactions
    even if the entire Depot is lost.
  <li>A depotID is a hardware token and identifies the BB Depot for all secure
    transactions.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</ol>

<a name="security">
<h3>6. Security Infrastructure</h3> </a>

<h4>6.1 Scope and Goals</h4>

There are two major items which need to be protected in BB system.
<ol>
  <li><b>Identity of BB</b><br>
      The identity is not BB ID. It is ultimately a private key of
	  the BB device because the BB private key is the key used to decrypt
	  eTickets issued to the BB. Unless the encryption
	  algorithm is broken, one can be certain that only the BB device can use eTickets issued
    to itself as long as the&nbsp; private key
	  is protected.
  <li><b>Secret Key for Content Encryption (Content Key)</b><br>
      Encryption takes place to protect content, but it makes no sense if
	  the key used to encrypt is not protected. Unless otherwise the encryption
	  algorithm to be used is broken, Content is secured as far as the secret
	  key for the encryption is protected.
</ol>
In addition to protect the above two items, BB server security infrastructure
needs to achieve the following goals:
<ol>
  <li><b>Basic security goals</b><br>  
      Those are <b>authentication (identity check)</b>, <b>confidentiality</b>,
	  and <b>data integrity</b>.
  <li><b>Build logical security barrier between components</b><br>
      One compromised server/component should not break entire security
	  mechanism. When compromised, it should be able to replace the compromised
	  server/component with minimum effect on other severs/components.
  <li><b>Activity monitoring and auditing</b><br>
      All activities of BB, BB depot, and BB servers/components needs to be
	  monitored and audited. Possible fraud should automatically be detected and
	  reported to BB server operators, and any BB depots or BB devices which are
	  involved in the fraud should be disabled - no further purchase or download
	  will not be proceeded.
</ol>

<h4>6.2 Security Guidelines</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Use encryption for confidentiality
  <li>Use digital signatures for data integrity
  <li>Use digital signatures and certificates for authentication
  <li>Who to trust:
    <ul>
    <li>Manufactures are not trusted entity
    <li>Studios are not trusted entity
    <li>Operation Center is trusted entity in a way that all security related
        processing will be logged and audited
    <li>Retailers are not trusted entity
    <li>BB Depot is not trusted device
    <li>BB is trusted device
	</ul>
  <li>Master Content in Studio (non encrypted content made by Release Kit) should
      not be in a form that can be played on BB
  <li>No repositories or data stores content without encryption if the content is in a
      form that can be played on BB
  <li>Private keys and security keys are encrypted by public key of BB server
      who owns these keys, and stored into repository. No repository stores
	  private keys and security keys in its original form.
  <li>Public keys can be stored into repository as is.
</ul>

<h4>6.3 Certificate Management</h4>

There are three certificate authorities for the security system for BB system
as below. All certificate authorities are derived from BroadOn's CA and
will be managed by BroadOn (private certificate authorities).
<ul>
  <li><b>BB Manufacture CA</b><br>
     This is the root CA for all certificates issued for BB devices. Derived
	 CA will be generated for each manufacture so that BB certificates can be
	 managed per manufacture.
  <li><b>BB-Depot Manufacture CA</b><br>
     This is the root CA for all certificates issued for BB Depots. Derived
	 CA will be generated for each manufacture so that BB-Depot certificates
	 can be managed per manufacture.
  <li><b>Studio CA</b><br>
     This is the root CA for all certificates issued for use in studio. Derived
	 CA will be generated for each operation center so that studio related
	 certificates can be managed per operation center.
  <li><b>Service CA</b><br>
     This is the root CA for all certificates issued for BB servers. Derived
	 CA will be generated for each operation center so that studio related
	 certificates can be managed per operation center. 
</ul>
