      This document describes the all protocols a BB Depot uses to
      communicate with the BB servers or BB player.  For a high-level
      description of the interactions between these parties, please
      refer to <a href="bbdepot_arch.html"><em>BB Depot Architecture</em></a>.
    </p>

    <h3>I. BB Activation</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Establish connection between BB and Depot
	<ul>
	  <li>boot sequence <font color=red>TBD</font>:  assume that once the BB is powered
	    on, it will try to establish network connection via the USB.</li>
	  <li>low-level protocol <font color=red>TBD</font>: The
	    physical link is USB.  <strike>Need to decide if we use DHCP or
	    PPP.  We just assume it talks TCP/IP for now.</strike>
	    The BB will not support IP.  We are using custom protocol
	    over raw USB instead. </li> 
	  <li>connection with Depot needs not be secure.  Security is
	    provided via end-to-end encryption directly between BB
	    and the server.</li>
	  <li>once connected to the Depot, the BB sends out its ID (BB
	    ID) and waits for instructions from Depot</li>
	</ul>
      </li>
      <li>Establish connection between Depot and Server
	<ul>
	  <li>Open SSL connection to the server, with both client and
	    server authentication.  As part of the SSL handshake, the
	    ID of the Depot is sent to the server.</li>
	  <li>As this is not a frequent activity, we are not using SSL
	    session.</li>
	  <li>Connection is made to a private port (port number
	    TBD).</li>
	</ul>
      </li>
      <li>Protocol: Depot and Server
	<ol type=a>
	  <li>Depot sends activation request to server:
	    <ol type=i>
	      <li>content length (in bytes)</li>
	      <li>request code (specify BB activation)</li>
	      <li>BB ID</li>
	    </ol>
	  </li>
	  <li>Server verifies BB ID and Depot ID against its database,
	    gets ready to authenticate BB, and sends the following reply:
	    <ol type=i>
	      <li>content length (in bytes)</li>
	      <li>return code (fixed length, specify if request is
		granted, rest of message omitted if request is rejected )</li>
	      <li>random string to be signed by BB.  (Note that this
		string needs only to be different every time, not
		necessarily random.)</li>
	    </ol>
	    Meanwhile, the server generates the certificate for this BB.
	  </li>
	  <li>Depot verifies request status, forwards random string to BB
	    to sign, and sends signature back to server:
	    <ol type=i>
	      <li>content length (length of signature in bytes)</li>
	      <li>signature</li>
	    </ol>
	  </li>
	  <li>Server verifies signature, records in database that this
	    BB has been activated, and returns the certificate and
	    status code to Depot: 
	    <ol type=i>
	      <li>content length</li>
	      <li>status code</li>
	      <li>BB's certificate</li>
	    </ol>
	  </li>
	  <li>Close connection</li>
	</ol>
      </li>
      <li>Protocol: Depot and BB
	<ol type=a>
	  <li>Upon establishing connection, BB sends its ID to
	    Depot</li>
	  <li>Depot forwards the random string from server for BB
	    authentication
	    <ol type=i>
	      <li>content length</li>
	      <li>command code (specify signature request)</li>
	      <li>string to be signed.</li>
	    </ol>
	  </li>
	  <li>BB replies with signature
	    <ol type=i>
	      <li>content length (length of signature in bytes)</li>
	      <li>signature</li>
	    </ol>
	  </li>
	  <li>Depot receives approval from server, download BB's
	    certificate and tells BB the transaction is completed
	    <ol type=i>
	      <li>content length</li>
	      <li>command code (specify activation completed)</li>
	      <li>BB's certificate</li>
	    </ol>
	  </li>
	  <li>BB acknowledge installation of certificate and close connection</li>
	</ol>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>II. BB Deactivation</h3>
    <p>Same as BB activation, except that the request code sent from
      Depot to Server is changed to deactivation request.  Only
      activated BB can be deactivated.  The Server enforces the
      deactivation policy, probably it must be within a certain time
      limit from last activation.</p>

    <h3>III. Purchase eTicket</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Establish connection between Depot and Server
	<ul>
	  <li>BB's memory module must be inserted to Depot</li>
	  <li>Open SSL connection to the server, with both client and
	    server authentication.  As part of the SSL handshake, the
	    ID of the Depot is sent to the server.</li>
	  <li>We might consider setting up an SSL session if this
	    happens frequent enough</li>
	</ul>
      </li>
      <li>Protocol: purchase request (between Depot and Server)
	<ol type=a>
	  <li>To minimize work on the server side, we use HTTPS</li>
	  <li>Depot "POST" a request to the server, with content:
	    <ol type=i>
	      <li>CMD=buy_ticket</li>
	      <li>BB_ID=<i>BB ID</i></li>
	      <li>TITLE=<i>ID of title</i></li>
	    </ol>
	  </li>
	  <li>Server records "store credit" for this BB for this title,
	    and replies HTTP status code "200 OK".  Error code TBD.
	  </li>
	  <li>If request is successful, the Depot writes a
	    <em>mark</em> on the memory module to indicate a new
	    eTicket is available for download.</li>
	</ol>
      </li>
      <li>Establish connection between Download Station and Server
	<ul>
	  <li>The BB at the Download Station is connected to the Depot
	    via the USB, and the Depot forwards the message to the
	    Server via a SSL connections.  The Server could verify the
	    Depot ID against the "store credit" record.</li>
	  <li>BB at the Download Station should authenticate itself to
	    the Depot (exact protocol TBD).</li>
	  <li>There are actually three different requests that the
	    Download Station could issue to the Server:
	    <ol type=i>
	      <li>list all new eTicket titles that has never been
		downloaded before</li>
	      <li>list all eTicket titles (for reloading previously
		owned eTickets)</li>
	      <li>download a particular eTicket</li>
	    </ol>
	</ul>
      </li>
      <li>Protocol: list new eTickets
	<ol type=a>
	  <li>BB sends to the server a request for all eTickets that
	    it has never downloaded
	    <ol type=i>
	      <li>content length</li>
	      <li>cmd code (specify "list new eTickets")</li>
	    </ol>
	  </li>
	  <li>Server replies with list
	    <ol type=i>
	      <li>content length</li>
	      <li>number of titles</li>
	      <li>list of title names and IDs delimited by null characters?
		(TBD)</li>
	    </ol>
	  </li>
	</ol>
      </li>
      <li>Protocol: list all eTickets
	<ol type=a>
	  <li>BB sends to the server a request for all eTickets that
	    it has never downloaded
	    <ol type=i>
	      <li>content length</li>
	      <li>cmd code (specify "list all eTickets")</li>
	      <li>BB ID (This is the ID read from the user's memory
		module, <strong>not</strong> the ID of the BB at the
		Download Station</li>
	    </ol>
	  </li>
	  <li>Server replies with list
	    <ol type=i>
	      <li>content length</li>
	      <li>number of titles</li>
	      <li>list of title names and IDs delimited by null characters?
		(TBD)</li>
	    </ol>
	  </li>
	</ol>
      </li>
      <li>Protocol: download eTicket
	<ol type=a>
	  <li>BB sends to the server a request for a particular Title
	    <ol type=i>
	      <li>content length</li>
	      <li>cmd code (specify "download eTicket")</li>
	      <li>title ID</li>
	      <li>BB ID (This is the ID read from the user's memory
		module, <strong>not</strong> the ID of the BB at the
		Download Station</li>
	    </ol>
	  </li>
	  <li>Server approves download request, and returns with
	    eTicket.  Note that if the eTicket is new, the server must
	    mark it as downloaded and thus the sale of this eTicket is
	    completed and final.
	    <ol type=i>
	      <li>content length</li>
	      <li>return code (ok or reject)</li>
	      <li>eTicket</li>
	    </ol>
	  </li>
	  <li>BB acknowledges receiving of eTicket and then close connection</li>
	</ol>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>IV. eTicket Refund</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>Establish connection between Depot and Server
	<ul>
	  <li>Same as in eTicket purchasing</li>
	</ul>
      </li>
      <li>Protocol: use HTTPS
	<ol type=a>
	  <li>Depot "POST" a request to the server (note: the Depot's
	    ID is sent to the Server as part of the SSL handshake):
	    <ol type=i>
	      <li>CMD=return_ticket</li>
	      <li>BB_ID=<i>BB_ID</i></li>
	      <li>TITLE=<i>ID of title</i></li>
	    </ol>
	  </li>
	  <li>Server checks against the refund policy (for details,
	    click <a href="eTicket.html">here</a>), and replies with
	    proper status/error code.  Error code TBD.  If refund is
	    approved, also returns the refund amount.
	  </li>
	</ol>
      </li>
    </ol>
		
    <h3>V. Content Download</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Establish connection between BB and Server
	<ul>
	  <li>Same procedures as in <em>Purchase eTicket</em>.</li>
	  <li>BB could use the <em>list all eTickets</em> command to
	    get a list of available titles</li>
	</ul>
      </li>
      <li>Protocol:
	<ol type=a>
	  <li>BB sends title ID and BB ID to Server (via HTTP "POST"
	    or similar, <font color=red>TBD</font>)
	    <ol type=i>
	      <li>content length</li>
	      <li>cmd code (specify content download)</li>
	      <li>BB ID</li>
	      <li>Title ID</li>
	    </ol>
	  </li>
	  <li>Server replies URL for content (could be HTTP
	    "redirect", <font color=red>TBD</font>)
	    <ol type=i>
	      <li>content length</li>
	      <li>return code</li>
	      <li>URL of content</li>
	    </ol>
	  </li>
	  <li>BB download content from specified URL</li>
	</ol>
	Note:  Depot <em>could</em> intercept the request and redirect
	traffic to its local cached copy of content.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>VI. Reinitialize Memory Module</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Memory Module connected to Depot console:
	<ol type=a>
	  <li>Write the Secure Kernel, Browser Apps License, and
	    Browser Apps to the first consecutive blocks on the memory
	    module that are not bad.</li>
	  <li>Re-initialize the file system</li>
	  <li>Mark FAT table for bad blocks</li>
	  <li>set up default file directories</li>
	</ol>
      </li>
      <li>Memory Module connected to User's BB, which is then
	connected to the Depot's BB Activation port:
	<ol type=a>
	  <li>copy BB's cert to memory module</li>
	  <li><font color=red>TBD:</font> (The following steps could be
	    performed by the user at the Download station)  Use the
	    "list all eTickets" and "download eTicket" protocols
	    specified in eTicket purchase to restore all eTickets.
	  </li>
	</ol>
      </li>
    </ol>
    
    <h3>VII. Content Distribution</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Content Distribution Server notifies each Depot the
	availability of new content:
	<ol type=a>
	  <li>Content Distribution Server (CDS) sends a Region ID to
	    the RMS, telling it to notify all Depots within that region.</li>
	  <li>RMS notify to Depot via RFRMP.</li>
	</ol>
	Note that the RMS is the server that maintain the latest IP
	address of each Depot.  It also needs to maintain the list of
	Depot that belongs to each region, and keeps this information
	consistent with the CDS (and also with the Online Transaction
	Server).
      </li>
      <li>Depot downloads the content:
	<ul>
	  <li>Depot connects to CDS and ask for a list of URLs
	    corresponding to the new content.</li>
	  <li>Go through the list of URLs and download all files.</li>
	  <li>We could use HTTP or HTTPS with <em>null</em> encryption
	    (i.e., authentication only).</li>
	  <li>The meta-data file, among other info, must contain:
	    <ol type=a>
	      <li>directory name to save these files</li>
	      <li>title of content</li>
	      <li>any logo or graphics (use by the download
		station)</li>
	      <li>checksum of content file</li>
	    </ol>
	  </li>
	  <li>Verify the checksum</li>
	</ul>
      </li>
      <strike>
      <li>Depot downloads re-encryption eTicket:
	<ul>
	  <li>Depot downloads the re-encryption eTickets for each of
	    the connected Download Station from the Online Transaction
	    Server.</li>
	  <li>Same protocol as downloading user eTickets (assuming
	    that the Depot knows the BB ID of all Download
	    Stations).</li>
	  <li>Server cancels the retry timer.</li>
	</ul>
      </li></strike>
    </ol>
    
    <h3>VIII. Ordering Hardware from Warehouse</h3>
    <p>
      <font color=red><em>This will not be supported in the first release.</em></font>
    </p>
    <p>
      This is basically a standard web-based online purchasing
      operation, using HTTPS.  Except that we do not use HTML because
      the console does not have a HTML-renderer.
    </p>
    
    <ol>
      <li>Depot downloads available item and price from server:
	<ul>
	  <li>use HTTPS with mutual authentication</li>
	  <li>information includes a list of available items (e.g, BB
	    player, memory module, etc.) and their corresponding
	    price, followed by the current balance for this
	    store.</li>
	</ul>
      </li>
      <li>Depot submit order:
	<ul>
	  <li>use HTTPS with mutual authentication</li>
	  <li>operator enter the selected items, quantity, etc. on the
	    console.  The console should display a confirmation page
	    with total amount, etc.</li>
	  <li>Depot submit order to the Server</li>
	</ul>
      </li>
      <li>Order tracking:
	<ul>
	  <li>use HTTPS with mutual authentication</li>
	  <li>server should display order status</li>
	</ul>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>IX. Delivering Hardware to Stores</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Carrier requests delivery confirmation:
	<ol type=a>
	  <li>Carrier replaces the Depot's USB token by his.</li>
	  <li>Depot console display dialogue asking for order
	    number.</li>
	  <li>Carrier enters order number</li>
	  <li>Depot connects to server, using carrier USB token for
	    identification, and submits the order number.</li>
	  <li>Server verifies that the carrier's ID matches that
	    assigned to deliver this order, and replies with order
	    details (items code, quantity, total price, etc.).</li>
	  <li>carrier removes his USB token</li>
	</ol>
      </li>
      <li>Store owners acknowledges delivery:
	<ol type=a>
	  <li>Store owner confirms the order detail, and acknowledge
	    delivery by putting back the Depot's USB token.</li>
	  <li>Using the Depot's USB token, the Depot signs the receipt
	    and sends it back to the server.</li>
	  <li>Server closes the transaction, deducts money from the
	    store's account, and closes the connection.</li>
	</ol>
      </li>
      <li>TBD: does the carrier have authority to modify the order, if
	something is wrong?
      </li>
    </ol>
