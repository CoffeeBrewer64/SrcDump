Source Code
------------

1) SCFS
- fs_mgr.c: Resource manager; SCFS and flash driver initialization
- fs_ops.c/h: File system operations
- fs_fat.c/h: FAT commit and load operations
- fs_block.c/h: FS block level writes and reads, interaction with driver
- fs_utils.h: FS utility functions, for testing and debugging

2) Flash device driver
- fl_ops.c/h: Flash operations
- fl_utils.h: Flash driver utility functions, for testing and debugging

Public header files, fs.h and flash.h, are located in sw/sc/include/.


Environment Variables
---------------------

1) FL_DEBUG_LOG
- Enable logging in the flash device driver
- Otherwise all flPrint, entry, and exit statements become void

2) FS_DEBUG_LOG
- Enable logging in the SCFS
- Otherwise all fsPrint, entry, and exit statements become void


Testing
-------

The FS can be run on the SCE with the following commands:

    arm-elf-merge -k sk.elf -s 0x8d00000 -f fs.elf -o os.elf
    sce -f -t 0x1ff --flashinit -o os.elf

It will attempt to open the flash device driver and mount the file system.
Check the output for errors.
