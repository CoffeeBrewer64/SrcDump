- fs_regr_test.c: Software regression tests
- fs_coproc.c: Multiple threads issuing FS commands

Public header files, fs.h and flash.h, are located in sw/sc/include/. The tests
utilize the FS and flash libraries and their header files (fs_ops.h, fs_utils.h,
fl_ops.h, fl_utils.h)


Environment Variables
---------------------

1) ISFS_DEBUG_LOG
- Enable logging in the SCFS
- Otherwise all fsPrint, entry, and exit statements become void

Run the regression tests on the SCE with the following commands:

    make runtests_regr
    make runtests_coproc

The tests should stop immediately if something went wrong. Check the output
for any error messages.
