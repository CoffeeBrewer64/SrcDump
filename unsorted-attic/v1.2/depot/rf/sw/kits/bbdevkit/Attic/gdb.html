<p>The iQue Software Development Kit provides a debugging environment for the iQue Player based on the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/gdb.html">GNU Debugger (GDB)</a>.  GDB is a command-line based source level debugger, but there are many <a href="#Usage GUI">graphical user interfaces</a> for it. The iQue Player debugging environment is composed of two parts: the iQue Player GDB, <em>ique_gdb</em>, running on the host machine and a GDB stub running on the iQue Player.  The GDB stub is part of the iQue Player debug library, <b>libultra_d</b>, and must be included in the program by the developer.  The GDB stub has to be running on the iQue Player before the program can be debugged.

<p>The user of the debugger interacts with GDB, and GDB will communicate the requests to the GDB stub on the iQue Player.  In order for the two components to communicate, there is a third helper tool, <i>mux</i>, that takes the input from GDB via a TCP socket and sends the information using RDB over USB to the iQue Player.  Note that because GDB and mux communicate via TCP, it is not necessary for GDB and mux to be on the same machine.

<p>The iQue Player debugger supports debugging the main CPU (i.e. the R4300 processor) of the iQue Player.  It allows the user to set breakpoints, step, display registers, variables, and thread information for the main CPU.  The debugger does not support debugging of the RCP (the graphics co-processor).

<p>The iQue debbuger is part of the iQue Software Development Kit.  Please see the iQue SDK documentation for the system requirements and how to install the iQue SDK.  The iQue debugger has been tested on RedHat Linux 9.0 and Windows XP with Cygwin 1.5.6-1.  After installing the iQue SDK, the iQue Player GDB program <i>ique_gdb</i> should be located in <i>$ROOT/usr/sbin</i>.  The following two sections describes how to prepare a iQue player program for debugging and how to use <em>ique_gdb</em> to debug the program.

<li>Create and start the GDB stub threads.
<p>To include the GDB stub in the program, the programmer should call <code>gdbInit()</code> to initialize and start the GDB stub threads.  

  <br><br>
  <b>GDB example</b>:
  <code><pre>
    gdbInit();</pre></code>
  The call to <code>gdbInit</code> effectively starts a thread with <code>gdbMain</code> as its entry point, a priority of <code>OS_PRIORITY_GDB</code> and a thread ID of <code>OS_TID_GDBMAIN</code>.  The following code fragment shows what <code>gdbInit()</code> does:

  <code><pre>
    static OSThread gdbThread;
    static u64      gdbStack[GDB_STACKSIZE/sizeof(u64)] __attribute__ ((aligned (8)));
    osCreateThread(&gdbThread, OS_TID_GDBMAIN, gdbMain, (void *)0,
                   (void *)(gdbStack + GDB_STACKSIZE/sizeof(u64)),(OSPri) OS_PRIORITY_GDB );
    osStartThread(&gdbThread);</pre></code>

  For backward compatibility with a program written to be debugged using RMON, creating a thread that calls <code>rmonMain</code> will create threads for the GDB stub instead.  

  <br><br>
  <b>RMON example</b> (deprecated):
  <code><pre>
    static OSThread rmonThread;
    static u64      rmonStack[RMON_STACKSIZE/sizeof(u64)] __attribute__ ((aligned (8)));
    osCreateThread(&rmonThread, OS_TID_RMONMAIN, rmonMain, (void *)0,
                   (void *)(rmonStack + RMON_STACKSIZE/8), (OSPri) OS_PRIORITY_RMON );
    osStartThread(&rmonThread);</pre></code>
</li>

<li>To distinguish between threads, give each thread an unique ID.  This is not enforced by the OS, but unless every thread has an unique ID, it will be difficult to determine which thread is which.</li><br>

<li>Restrict user thread priorities to the range 1 to 127 (OS_PRIORITY_APPMAX), with 127 being the highest priority.  The idle thread must has a priority of 0 (OS_PRIORITY_IDLE).  This is not enforced by the OS, but is necessary for the debugger to function properly.  The debugger determines which threads are user threads based on the priority, and if the thread priorities are not set appropriately, the debugger may not function and may cause the system to hang.
<p>Some possible scenarios are:
d118 4
a121 9
    <li>If the idle thread priority is not set to 0, the debugger will not be able to identify which thread is the idle thread.  If the debugger suspends the idle thread, the system will lock up.  To prevent this from happening, the debugger will not suspend any user thread, but may not function correctly.</li>
    <li>If the user thread priority is too high, the debugger and USB threads may never run.  It will be impossible to debug the program then.</li>
  </ul>
</li><br>

<li>Compile a debug version and link with the libultra debugging library</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Use the <b>-g</b> option with gcc to compile a debug version of the program</li>
    <li>Link with <b>libultra_d</b></li>

     Connect the cable between your linux host and the iQue player and follow the steps below to start a debugging session with GDB:
d130 18
a147 14
<li>Start mux on the host machine so that it is ready for GDB to connect to it via TCP.  By default, <i>mux</i> will listen on TCP port 8088 for GDB debugger messages.  You can select a different port by using the <code>--debugport</code> option</li>
<li>Start the program to be debugged on the iQue Player</li>
<li>Start the GDB debugger on the host machine (or another machine that has network connectivity to the host machine)
  <ul>
    <li><code>
     ique_gdb &lt;elf file&gt; <br>
    </code></li> 
  </ul>
   See <a href="#Usage GUI">Graphical Front Ends to GDB</a> for how to run <em>ique_gdb</em> with
a GUI.
</li>
<li>Connect to the iQue Player from GDB via <i>mux</i>.<br>
    At the GDB prompt type <code>target remote &lt;machine name&gt;:&lt;port&gt</code>.
    For instance, if <i>mux</i> and GDB are running on the same machine with the default port:
d149 1
a149 1
      <li>target remote localhost:8088
d151 2
a152 1
</li>
d154 11
a164 4

Once GDB has attached to the target, all user threads will be stopped and the program can now be debugged.  See the <a href="http://sources.redhat.com/gdb/current/onlinedocs/gdb_toc.html"> GDB User Guide</a> for more information on how to use GDB.  When you are done debugging, use the &quot;<code>detach</code>&quot; command to stop the GDB debugging session and resume execution of the program.  If you want to leave the application stopped so another debugger can connect to it, use the &quot;<code>disconnect</code>&quot; command to disconnect from the iQue player.  Only one debugger can connect to the iQue player at a time, so make sure that you've disconnected or detach from the iQue player when you are finished debugging.

       For a visual debugging environment, there are several applications that can supplies a graphical front-end to GDB:
  <ul>
     <li><a href=http://www.gnu.org/software/ddd><b>DDD</b></a> (Data Display Debugger)<br>
        <b>Note:</b> DDD does not display all the thread information that the iQue Player provides.
          Use the command <code>"info threads"</code> in the gdb console window to get the full information.
        <pre>Usage:   <code>ddd --debugger &lt;gdb&gt; &lt;elf file&gt;</code></pre>
        <pre>Example: <code>ddd --debugger "$ROOT/usr/sbin/ique_gdb" &lt;elf file&gt;</code></pre>
     </li>
     <li><a href=http://libre.act-europe.fr/gvd><b>GVD</b></a> (GNU Visual Debugger)</a><br>
        GVD is integrated into <a href=http://libre.act-europe.fr/gps/>GPS</a>
        (GNAT Programming System).<br>    
        <b>Note:</b> Do not use the code disassembly feature in GVD.  That does not work well with
          the iQue Player.
        <pre>Usage:   <code>gps --debugger=&lt;gdb&gt; --debug=&lt;elf file&gt;</code></pre>
        <pre>Example: <code>gps --debugger="$ROOT/usr/sbin/ique_gdb" --debug=&lt;elf file&gt;</code></pre>
     </li>
   </ul>

<a name="Limitations"></a>

<p>Because the iQue Player debugger runs in the same memory space as the user program and its reliance on RDB/USB for communication with GDB, the iQue Player debugger has several limitations in how it can be used.  These limitations imply that the user must be very careful in how the debugger is used.

<p><b>When using the debugger, the following should be avoided:</b>
<ul>
<li>Never try to stop or step into the GDB stub threads or the USB threads.  If you attempt to do this, and one of the GDB stub thread or USB thread hits a break, then the debugger will cease to function.</li>

<p>A summary of the system threads that you should not interfere with is given below:

<br>
<li>Never try to stop, step into, or set breakpoints in the idle thread.  If the idle thread stops, it will cause the entire system to lock up.</li>
<br>
<li>Never try to put a breakpoint in or step into an operating system function.  Because the system functions are shared by GDB stub, the USB thread, placing a breakpoint or stepping into these functions may also cause the GDB stub thread or USB thread to hit a break.</li>
<br>
<li>Do not use watchpoints in GDB.  GDB uses software watchpoints that will automatically set breakpoints in the running program and will very likely set breakpoints in the GDB stub and USB threads, causing the debugger to stop working.</li>
<br>
<li>Do not use <code>osSetEventMesg</code> to register message queues for <code>OS_EVENT_FAULT</code> or <code>OS_EVENT_CPU_BREAK</code> 
    events if you want to use the GDB debugger.  Since only one message queue may be associated with one event, the GDB stub will defer 
    to the user program if the user program attempts to register messages queues for these events.  This means that the GDB stub will not
    get notified if there is a CPU fault or a breakpoint.  If the GDB stub does not get notified of breakpoints, you cannot use GDB
    to set breakpoints and to step through your problem.  If the GDB stub does not get notified of CPU faults, then GDB cannot inform

<p><b>The debugger will not be able to debug all programs or problems.</b>
d293 33

<li>It cannot be used to debug problems with the RDB or USB since it relies on these two components to function</li>
<br>
<li>It is of limited use when debugging application startup.  Since the GDB stub must be running before the program can be debugged, it is impossible to debug anything that happens before that.  
<p>
To enable as much debugging of the start-up code as possible, the developer should minimize the boot procedure and have the thread that is started by the boot function do the following (in order): 
   <ul>
      <li>Call <code>gdbInit()</code>. This will create and start the GDB stub threads and allow the program to be debugged.</li>
      <li>Create but do not start the rest of the threads in the program.  This will allow the program to start up in a stopped state.  The developer can then attach to the program using GDB and start up the threads within the debugger (by using the continue command).  This gives the developer a chance to set breakpoints at the begining of the thread and to watch the startup of the thread.</li>
      <li>Lower the priority of the thread to 0 and have it become the idle thread.</li>
   </ul>
</li>
<br>
<li>Because the debugger changes the timing of the application and the scheduling of the threads, the debugger is also of limited use when debugging multithreaded problems (i.e. deadlock, race conditions, etc).</li>
<br>
<li>Since the software program and the debug support are all in the same memory space, it is possible for a bug (i.e. buffer overflow) in the software program to stomp over the GDB stub.  At which point, the debugger will not be of use any longer.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>The following are not supported by the iQue Player debugger:</b>
<ul>
  <li>Debugging the Reality Coprocessor.</li>
  <li>Watchpoints.</li>
  <li>Sending signals to the iQue Player.</li>

   <li>If the PC is invalid (e.g. by trying to jump to an invalid function pointer), then 
      the stack backtrack is unavailable.
      <em>ique_gdb</em> is based on GDB 6.0 and there appears to be a problem with GDB 6.0 frames support for the MIPS processor.  Once GDB 6.1 becomes available, we will check whether the new version fixes the problem.</li>
   <br>
   <li>The iQue Player can get into a state where it stops communicating with the <em>ique_gdb</em> program.  If you encounter this, restart the application, <em>ique_gdb</em>, <em>mux</em> and try again.</li>
   <br>
   <li>If more than one GDB tries to connect to the iQue player, the second GDB will just hang.  Only one GDB can connect to the iQue Player at a time.  Do not try to use multiple GDBs at the same time.</li>
   <br>
   <li>If multiple threads are faulted or stopped due to different causes, only one cause can be reported back to GDB.  The GDB Remote Serial Protocol only allows for one signal to be sent to GDB when the program stops.</li>
