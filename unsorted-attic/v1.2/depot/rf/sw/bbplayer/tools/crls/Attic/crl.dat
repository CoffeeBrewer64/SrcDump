First write the following in a line
privateKeyFile type subtype versionnumber date issuer 4096/2048(Signature len) numberRevoked

type is integer from one of these
#define BB_CRL_TYPE_TS 0  /* ticket server */
#define BB_CRL_TYPE_CP 1  /* content publishing server */
#define BB_CRL_TYPE_CA 2  /* ca server */
#define BB_CRL_TYPE_CT 3  /* content */

subtype is if CA revocation is done, which one or both: pick from 
#define  CPCA_REV 0
#define    LSCA_REV 1
#define  CPLSCA_REV 2
(or zero if it is not a CA revocation)

Then in each line write the name of the server to revoke (match numberRevoked
