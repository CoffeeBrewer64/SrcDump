<h2>New Online Purchase Model</h2>
<h3>Problems that need to be solved:</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Since the BB Card is <b>not</b> a secure device, eTickets that have
been issued cannot be easily revoked.</li>
  <li>Returning of eTicket or BB Player should be avoided because this allows
a shop owner to rent out games without paying us. &nbsp;On the other hand,
returns are necessary for both customer satisfaction reason and handling of
human error.</li>
  <li>The current model of "pay first, download next" is too complicated.<br>
  </li>
</ol>
Before we outline the solutions to the above two, we need to introduce a new
mechanism:<br>
<br>
<h3>BB Player Version number</h3>
We need to reserve a number in the internal flash of a BB Player. &nbsp;Let's
call this "Player Version" (PV). &nbsp;This number is controlled by the secure
kernel and can only be increased. &nbsp;On the server side, we keep a corresponding
"Server Version" (SV). &nbsp;Furthermore, embedded into each eTicket is a
"Ticket Version" (TV) which always equal to the current value of SV.<br>
<br>
Initially, both PV and SV equal to zero.<br>
<br>
Upon activation, SV is incremented by one. &nbsp;All eTickets that are subsequently
issued will then have TV equals to SV, which in this case is "1".<br>
<br>
When a BB Player is turned on and a game is loaded, and if PV &lt; TV, then
the value of TV is copied to PV.<br>
<br>
After&nbsp; PV is synchronized with TV, the player will allow a game to be
player only when PV == TV. &nbsp;Otherwise, the eTicket is considered invalid
and the player refuses to play the game.<br>
<br>
To return a BB Player, we need to increment SV by one, and then copy this
new SV value to PV. &nbsp;This effectively invalidates all eTickets issued
to this player.<br>
<br>
Programmatically:<br>
<br>
<b>activate:</b><br>
<pre><tt>	++SV;<br>	TV = SV;</tt><br></pre>
<b>play:<br>
</b>
<pre><tt>	if (PV &lt; TV)<br>	  PV = TV;<br>	if (PV == TV)<br>	  play game;<br>	else<br>	  reject game;<br></tt></pre>
<b>return:</b>
<pre><tt>	++SV;<br>	PV = SV;</tt></pre>
What this mechanism allows is to do is that:<br>
<ol>
  <li>it allows us to tell if any game has been played since a Player was
activated (i.e., whether PV == SV).</li>
  <li>it allows us to invalidate all eTickets issued to this Player (BB Player
needs to be present).</li>
  <li>it allows a Player to be reset to a state that can be re-sold to another
customer.</li>
</ol>
Furthermore, we could extend this mechanism to invalidate a single eTicket.
&nbsp;This can be effectively done by first invalidate all eTickets, and then
re-issue those eTickets that we want to keep.<br>
<br>
<h3>Preventing Game Rental</h3>
&nbsp;It's fundamentally a conflicting requirement to prevent game rental
(i.e., no return) and at the same time allow returns. &nbsp;In light of that,
we could employ a business solution rather than a technical one:<br>
<br>
We believe that <i>as long as there is a cost to return a game, and this
cost is higher than any profit a retailer might earn from renting it out,
</i>he would have no incentive to cheat by returning a used game.<br>
<br>
As a policy, we will charge a fee for returning an eTicket, and this fee
is proportional to the length of time that game has been sold. &nbsp;For
example, there will be no returning fee if an eTicket is returned within
15 minutes of sale, or the first 10 returns of a month, assuming that these
are just honest mistakes. &nbsp;As the length of time increases, the return
fee would be higher. &nbsp;After a certain period of time, say, 30 days,
no refund would be issued. &nbsp;We could also increase the return fee if
the same game for the same player is returned over and over again.<br>
<br>
Again, this policy only applies to the amount of refund we give the retailer.
&nbsp;A retailer could always choose to give a full refund or no refund at
all to the customers.<br>
<br>
<h3>BB Player Purchase</h3>
When purchasing a new BB Player, we propose that the individualization of
the BB Card, and downloading of any new eTickets <b>AND </b>the &nbsp;corresponding
game content be done at the same time, through the BB Initialization Port.
<br>
This allows a one shot purchase and the Player is ready to go. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
With the new mechanism, we can implement a return policy based on:<br>
<ol>
  <li>If the BB Player has been used, and</li>
  <li>the length of time the BB Player has been sold.</li>
</ol>
Furthermore, if a retailer accept such a player for return, he can always
invalidate all existing eTickets on this player and re-sale it to another
customer.<br>
<h3>eTicket Purchase</h3>
We propose a simplified purchasing model. &nbsp;When a customer has already
purchased a BB Player, and returns to the store with his BB Card, he can
go straight to the Download Station, browse and download any game. &nbsp;He
then takes the BB Card to the Depot Console and pays for it, effectively
downloading the eTicket for that game. &nbsp;This is similar to the "super
market model", where you pick the merchandise first, and pay later.<br>
<br>
As an optional enhancement, we could allow a demo license to be loaded with
the game. &nbsp;A customer could then select and download a game he likes,
go home and try it out, and come back to pay for the full version later.<br>
<br>
This model is similar to the old model in that there is a user confirmation
step (which is the selection of the game). &nbsp;And this releases the responsibility
of the shop owner for making mistakes. &nbsp;Furthermore, we can simplify
the Retail App by automatically showing the eTicket purchase screen for the
game that has been downloaded on the BB Card but has not been purchased.<br>
<br>
Another benefit of this model is that it eliminates the need to have the
DepotID inserted when the customer downloads a game.<br>
<br>
The only drawback is that if the customer wants to return a game, he would
have to bring back the BB Player. &nbsp;But this is not unreasonable because
he has already spent time selecting, downloading, and possibly even playing
the game, and if he still wants to change his mind, he needs to do more.<br>
