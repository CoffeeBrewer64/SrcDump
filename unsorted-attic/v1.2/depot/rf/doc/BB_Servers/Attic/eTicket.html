      <h3>I. Motivation</h3>
      <p>
	The old model has several problems that we need to solve:
	<ol>
	  <li>There is no practical way to revoke a eTicket.  It is
	    unacceptable not to refund the customer if a
	    wrong eTicket is issued because of operator error.
	  </li>
	  <li>One way avoid this problem is to shift the
	    responsibility to the customer.  That is, we require the
	    customer to verify the eTicket title and give explicit 
	    confirmation before the transaction is processed. However,
	    this requires extra hardware (e.g., an extra display and
	    keypad) on the BB Depot.</li>
	  <li>Instead of providing extra hardware, we could overload
	    the download station to be used for confirmation of
	    purchases.  But this requires exclusive access to the
	    download station during the entire purchasing process.</li>
	</ol>
      </p>
      <h3>II. The New Model</h3>
      <p>
	The key idea is to decouple customer payment from the
	actual processing of the eTickets.  From the customer's point
	of view, it takes the following steps to purchase a eTicket:
	<ol>
	  <li>customer selects a game title</li>
	  <li>customer pays for the selected game, and hands over his memory
	    module to the shop owner</li>
	  <li>shop owner registers a <em>store credit</em> for the
	    selected game with the BB as identified by the memory module, and
	    returns the memory module to the customer</li>
	  <li>customer walks over to the download station, inserts the memory
	    module, and selects from a menu on the display for eTicket
	    purchases.</li>
	  <li>the display shows all the titles associated with this BB
	    for which it has store credit.</li>
	  <li>customer selects the eTicket(s) that he wants to download,
	    confirm the selection, and
	    removes the memory module when the transaction is
	    complete.  </li>
	</ol>
      </p>
      <p>
	Note that once a eTicket is downloaded, it cannot be revoked.
	However, in the new model the customer is given a chance to
	confirm the purchase.  As long as the eTicket has not been
	downloaded, he could go back to the shop owner and switch his
	store credits for another game. 
      </p>
      <h3>III. Store Credits</h3>
      <p>
	Store Credits (SC) is a new concept that requires some
	explanation.  It is a record in our server database that contains:
	<ol>
	  <li>BB ID</li>
	  <li>Depot ID</li>
	  <li>cash value</li>
	  <li>game title ID</li>
	</ol>
	When a customer purchases a game via a particular BB Depot, an
	SC record is created in the server's database.  It is a token
	that binds the BB and the Depot with the specified game.  When
	the customer redeems the SC for a eTicket, it will be issued
	for that particular BB and that particular game only.
      </p>
      <p>
	The reason for using such a restrictive SC is that the
	removable memory module by itself is <strong>not</strong> a
	secure device (i.e., it could be cloned).  If we use a
	cash-based SC, a malicious user who got hold of a victim's BB
	ID could use the victim's SC to purchase any game.  Even
	though the games purchased are still owned by the victim and
	the corresponding eTickets are useless to the malicious user,
	the victim would end up with games that he might not want to
	purchase.
      </p>
      <h4>Refund</h4>
      <p>
	Refund is allowed provided the refund request is issued from the
	same BB Depot shown in the SC record, and the corresponding
	eTicket has not been redeemed.  The original shop that creates
	the SC record <em>owns</em> the sale, and it is the only shop
	that is authorized to issue refund.
      </p>
      <p>This restriction is important to prevent a malicious shop
	owner from requesting refund (and hence gets money from us)
	for arbitrary customers without actually paying
	them.  We still have no way to know if the shop owner who made
	the original sale actually returns the money to his customer,
	but at least this customer would know who to complain.
      </p>
      <p>
	The refund process is designed to handle operator errors and
	allow the customer to change his mind after making the
	purchase.  A refund request is expected to be made while the
	customer is still in the store.  In practice, we should set
	a short time limit after which no refund is allowed.  This
	<em>"while customer is in store"</em> refund policy is needed also to
	guard against a malicious user requesting refund on SC that a
	victim owns but has not redeemed, assuming it is hard to
	pretend to be the victim while he is still in the store.
      </p>

      <h4>Exchange</h4>
      <p>
	If the shop owner makes a mistake and issue a purchase request
	for the wrong game title, or the customer changes his mind
	before redeeming the SC, an exchange request can be made.
	Effectively, an exchange is just a refund of the original SC,
	followed by a new purchase request, and then the shop owner
	refunds or collect the difference in price.  As such, an
	exchange request is subject to the same restriction as a
	refund, i.e., same Depot, same BB, and limit to a short period
	of time after the initial sales.
      </p>

      <h3>IV. Gift Certificates</h3>
      <p>
	Two gift models have been discussed.  The preferred model is
	described first, followed by reasons why the second model is
	rejected.
      </p>
      <p>
	Gift certificates are cash-based.  They are pre-printed gift
	cards of fixed denominations.  Each gift certificate is
	imprinted with a unique ID number (or bar code, or magnetic
	stripe).  A valid gift certificate ID number should be hard to
	guess.  Gift certificates has no value until activated, at
	which point the server records the ID number, cash value, and
	the BB Depot ID in its database.  Gifts certificates should be
	activated after a shop owner collects money from the customer.
      </p>
      <p>
	Gift certificates could be used as cash for purchasing games.
	So customers should treat them as cash and we are not
	responsible for loss or illegal duplication.  To redeem a gift
	certificate, its ID number is entered into the BB Depot which
	sends it to the server for verification.  If everything
	verifies, the shop owner will be credited with the proper
	amount and the certificate ID will be voided.  The shop owner
	might need to make cash changes if the purchase amount is
	smaller than that of the gift certificate.
      </p>
      <p>
	For the record, another gift model was previously proposed.
	In that model, gift certificates are bound to a particular BB
	upon activation and can be only redeemed by it.  This model
	provides more protection for the gift recipients but is too
	inconvenient and restrictive for the gift senders.  First,
	many people like to purchase multiple gifts before deciding to
	whom they would send them.  Second, it requires our customers
	to broadcast their user names to all potential gift senders.
      </p>


      <h3>V. Security Analysis</h3>
      <p>
	Given that the memory module carried by a customer is
	<strong>not</strong> a secure device, there is no guarantee that
	its content cannot be duplicated.  As a result, it is possible
	to steal the identity of a BB owner by cloning his memory
	module.  We decided to trade off this security risk for user
	convenience.
      </p>
      <p>
	It is still possible to minimize the security risk.  
	Limiting the time where refund and exchange can be made
	substantially reduces the window of opportunity for an
	identity thief.  In fact, most customers are expected to
	finish a purchase transaction within a few minutes.
      </p>
      <p>
	Another way to reduce the vulnerability is to include a sequence
	number with the BB ID (with proper encryption, digital
	signature, etc.).  This sequence number is incremented every
	time the memory module is plugged in back to the BB
	controller.  To authenticate a user, the server checks that
	the sequence number is greater than or equal to the one use in
	the last transaction.  This scheme does not fully authenticate
	a customer, but at least invalidates the stolen identity upon
	the real owner's next visit.
