      <h2>I. Transactions</h2>

      <h3>1. Purchase eTicket</h3>
d28 45
a72 3
	An eTicket purchase transaction involves three parties:  the
	issuer of the eTicket (BB server), the shop owner/sales person
	(BB Depot), and the customer (BB).
d74 2
d77 20
a96 68
	<li>Requirement:
	  <ol type=1>
	    <li>Mutual Authentication:
	      <ol type=a>
		<li>BB Depot must authenticate itself to the BB
		  server (<em>shop owner cannot deny a transaction</em>).
		</li>
		<li>BB must authenticate itself to the BB server
		  (<em>reject BB clones -- if cloning is possible</em>)</li>
		<li>BB server must authenticate itself
		  independently to the BB Depot and the BB
		  (<em>no other party can use our distribution system</em>)</li>
	      </ol>
	    </li>
	    <li>Transaction:
	      <ol type=a>
		<li>Each BB Depot has a transaction quota, when
		  the quota is exceeded, no new eTicket can be
		  purchased.</li> 
		<li>Each transaction must be undeniably linked to
		  a unique BB Depot.  Collection from each shop
		  owner is based on completed transactions.</li>
		<li>A transaction is completed after the eTicket
		  is loaded into the specific BB.</li>
		<li>If a transaction does not complete, we need to
		  guarantee that the eTicket is not loaded into the
		  BB, nor saved or cached on the BB Depot</li>
	      </ol>
	    </li>

	    <li>Communication between BB Depot and BB server is
	      carried out via a secure channel.
	    </li>
	    <li>Communication between BB and BB server is carried out
	      via a secure channel, with messages encrypted
	      independently from the BB Depot (i.e., BB Depot simply
	      passes through the data, but cannot peek into its content).</li>
	    <li>Connection between the BB and the BB Depot must be 
	      physically point-to-point so that the shop
	      owner/sales person can easily match the BB with the
	      purchase transaction.  That is, the BB is connected to a
	      dedicated physical port identifiable both by software
	      and visually by the operator.
	    </li>
	  </ol>
	</li>
	
	<li>Policy:
	  <ol type=1>
	    <li>The transaction quota is set and renewed based on
	      payment and/or deposit made by the shop owner.</li>
	    <li>The shop owner is responsible for all completed
	      transactions made via the BB Depot.  This implies that
		access to the BB Depot console must be protected
	      -- probably via a user id and password scheme.
	    </li>
	  </ol>
	</li>

	<li>Pre-conditions
	  <ol type=1>
	    <li>Internet connection must be up</li>
	    <li>(One of the) BB server must be online</li>
	    <li>eTicket for that title and BB has not been issued</li>
	    <li>Title content already downloaded to BB Depot (<em>Is
		this really needed?</em>)</li>
	  </ol>
	</li>

      <h3>2. Activate a BB</h3>
      <p>A new BB is activated implicitly when the first eTicket is
	purchased (first eTicket might be free).
d109 7
d117 1
d119 8
a126 18
	<li>Requirement:<br>
	    Same as purchasing of eTickets.
	</li>
	<li>Policy:<br>
	    Upon activation, a BB purchase transaction associated with
	    this BB Depot will be generated.  This is considered a
	    sale of the BB by the shop owner.  This implies that:
	    <ol type=a>
	      <li>The shop owner cannot activate BB devices when the
		Internet connection is down.</li>
	      <li>If a shop owner sales a BB device without activating
		it, we will not be able to collect money, and no other
		shop owner would be willing to activate that BB.</li>
	      <li>A shop owner <em>could</em> pre-activate some BB devices
		as long as s/he is willing to pay for them.</li>
	    </ol>
	</li>

      <h3>3. Revoke eTicket</h3>
      <p>
	An eTicket purchase transaction can be revoked, in which case
	the eTicket is erased from the BB, and the title content, if
	already loaded, should be deleted also.
      </p>
d131 4
a134 24
	<li>Requirement:
	  <ol type=a>
	    <li>Mutual authentication and secure communication are
	      required, as in the case of purchasing eTickets.</li>
	    <li>Needs to guarantee that the eTicket is actually
	      erased from the BB.</li>
	    <li>The eTicket to be revoked must match the BB id on
	      the corresponding eTicket purchase record, but the BB
	      Depot could be different.</li>
	    <li>Transaction quota and/or deposit of the corresponding
	      BB Depot will be credited accordingly</li>
	    <li>The BB server could reject a eTicket revocation
	      request (see policy below).</li>
	  </ol>
	</li>
	<li>Policy:<br>
	    An eTicket can be revoked only within a certain time limit
	    after its purchase.  This time limit is determined by the
	    BB server and should be dynamically configurable on a per
	    BB Depot basis. The
	    purpose of the time limit is to avoid shops renting the
	    game without paying.  The only legitimate eTicket
	    revocation are mistakes made in the purchase transactions.
	</li>

      <h3>4. Deactivate a BB</h3>
      <p>
	Subject to the same restriction as revoking an eTicket, a BB
	recently sold could be deactivated.
      </p>
      
      <h3>5. Download a Title</h3>
d139 1
d141 15
a155 33
	<li>Requirement:
	  <ol type=a>
	    <li>Can connect with multiple BB's at the same time</li>
	    <li>Can operate even when Internet connection is down, as
	      long as the title content is cached.</li>
	    <li>Does not involve shop owner</li>
	    <li>BB and the BB Depot need to authenticate each
	      other</li>
	    <li>BB Depot does not check for existence or validity of
	      the eTicket (it has no knowledge to check anyway).</li>
	    <li>It's the BB's responsibility to decide if it has
	      enough memory for the title to be downloaded.</li>
	    <li>BB Depot needs to provide size information of a title
	      upon request</li>
	    <li>BB Depot could request BB to report the current memory
	      layout (titles and tag-along content loaded, free space,
	      etc.).</li>
	    <li>BB Depot may tag along additional content with the
	      requested title, if space is available.</li>
	    <li>BB Depot needs to log all title download transactions
	      and report periodically to the BB server (though not
	      necessarily in real time).</li>
	  </ol>
	</li>
	<li>Implementation Notes:
	  <br>As far as the BB is concerned, it is communicating
	    directly with the BB server.  The BB Depot simply acts as a
	    transparent caching proxy.  This allows any BB connecting
	    directly to the Internet to download content without going
	    through the BB Depot (if we want to support it).  The
	    transparent caching proxy allows the BB Depot continue to
	    function even when the Internet connection is down.

      <h3>6. Tag-along Content</h3>
      <p>Tag-along content is additional information downloaded to the
d207 50
a256 2
	free (and automatically downloaded).</p>
      <p>Download Policy:
d258 198
a455 18
	  <li>Downloading of tag-along content is controlled by the BB
	    Depot</li>
	  <li>The BB Depot decides which content to tag-along with the
	    title content download, based on:
	    <ol type=a>
	      <li>BB id</li>
	      <li>title being downloaded</li>
	      <li>free space available</li>
	    </ol>
	  </li>
	  <li>The BB Depot decides if old tag-along content should be
	    removed.</li>
	  <li>Title content always have priority over tag-along
	    content, i.e., tag-along content is automatically removed,
	    if necessary, to make room for title content.</li>
	  <li>When showing the amount of free space on the BB's
	    display, it should include the space taken by tag-along
	    content.</li>

      <h2>III. New Title Release</h2>
      <ol>
	<li>Requirement
	  <ul>
	    <li>All new title and tag-along content are pushed from the
	      Content Distribution Server down to the BB Depot.</li>
	    <li>Mutual authentication is required, but encryption is not
	      needed (each content is individually encrypted).</li>
	    <li>Each BB Depot should reserve a certain amount of disk
	      space for content, and report the disk utilization to the BB
	      server.</li>
	    <li>Selection of titles to download (and remove) is controlled
	      by the BB server.</li> 
	    <li>Each BB Depot should contain a complete
	      collection of all titles.</li>
	    <li>BB Depot should report title download statistics to the BB
	      server</li>
	  </ul>
	</li>
	<li>Issues
	  <ul>
	    <li>Should we support BB Depots with different disk
	      sizes?</li>
	    <li>Should we allow BB Depots to store only a subset of
	      titles?  If so, what do we do when a customer requests a
	      title that is not locally available?
	    </li>
	</li>
      </ol>
      

      <h2>IV. BB Depot Console</h2>
      <p>
	This is the interactive input output device for initiating
	transactions on the BB Depot.  The exact configuration is yet
	to be determined, but should satisfy the following
	requirements:
	<ol>
	  <li>Access to the console should be protected (probably with
	    a user id/password pair).
	  </li>
	  <li>Communication between the console and the BB Depot
	    should be protected (e.g. physically via a direct cable
	    connection). </li>
	  <li>Should we support more than one console per BB
	    Depot?</li>
	  <li>Should the display be text-based (dumb terminal) or
	    graphical? Color or Monochrome?</li> 
	  <li>Should input be numeric keyboard, full keyboard, or
	    touch screen?  Any pointing device (mouse)?
	</ol>
      </p>

      <h2>V. Other Software Components</h2>
      <p>
	The assumption is that the BB Depot is based on the
	SME/Wireless model with necessary modifications:
	<ul>
	  <li>Required components:
	    <ol type=a>
	      <li>Secure gateway: router, firewall, NAT</li>
	      <li>Disk support: journal file system (logical volume?)</li>
	      <li>crypto library and utilities</li>
	      <li>network service: DHCP, DNS</li>
	      <li>software update</li>
	      <li>system status monitor</li>
	      <li>remote management</li>
	    </ol>
	  </li>
	  <li>Depending on whether we want to allow the BB Depot to
	    also act as an SME gateway, the following components could
	    be removed:
	    <ol type=a>
	      <li>Wireless network</li>
	      <li>Web server</li>
	      <li>SMB server</li>
	      <li>local web-based configuration?</li>
	      <li>email</li>
	      <li>VPN</li>
	      <li>print server</li>
	      <li>backup service</li>
	    </ol>
	  </li>
	  <li>New components:
	    <ol type=a>
	      <li>device driver for BB Depot console.</li>
	      <li>activity monitor</li>
	      <li>BB Depot main apps.</li>
	      <li>(modified) transparent caching proxy</li>
	      <li>device driver for connecting the non-standard
		network port on a BB??</li>
	    </ol>
	  </li>
	  <li>Issues:
	    <ol type=a>
	      <li>Does the BB Depot have a dedicated broadband
		connection?  Or could the connection be shared
		by other PC's using the BB Depot as a gateway?</li>
	      <li>We do require the BB Depot to sit at the
		<em>edge</em> of the Internet (i.e., no other
		firewall, NAT router sitting in front of it).</li>
	      <li>Any security concern if we allow other PC to connect
		to the BB Depot?</li>
	    </ol>
	  </li>
	</ul>
      </p>

      <h2>VI. Hardware</h2>

      Mostly undecided at this point, but the assumption is to base on
      the SME/Wireless model with modifications:

      <ul>
	<li>BB Depot console: dumb terminal? VGA display? TV monitor?
	  Touch screen?</li>
	<li>BB Depot console connection: serial cable? USB? graphic
	  card on mini-pci?</li> 
	<li>PCMCIA is not needed</li>
	<li>USB is not needed? (if not used for BB Depot console)</li>
	<li>connection with BB -- do we need special hardware to
	  support the non-standard Ethernet port on BB? Do we need
	  special cable?  Do we need special hub for connecting
	  multiple BB's for content download?  How does a BB draw
	  power from BB Depot?</li>
	<li>UPS - built into power brick or external?</li>
      </ul>
