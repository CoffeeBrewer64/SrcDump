      <h2>I. Hardware</h2>
a18 78
      <h4>Main Module</h4>
      
      1. Requirements:
      <ul>
	<li>mother board: mini ATX</li>
	<li>memory: 64MB</li>
	<li>Ethernet: one 10/100</li>
	<li>hard disk: IDE ATA66, 20GB or more</li>
	<li>USB version 1.1, needs at least 5 connectors (i.e., need
	  internal USB hub)
	  <ol type=i>
	    <li>connect to new BB for activation</li>
	    <li>connect to download station</li>
	    <li>interface with memory module (USB block device)</li>
	    <li>secure USB token</li>
	    <li>printer</li>
	  </ol>
	</li>
	<li>secure memory (e.g. USB security token) for certificate and private key.</li>
	<li>BB memory module connector, for eTicket purchasing.</li>
	<li>5.5" LCD with touchscreen (minimal
	  graphics capability for displaying Chinese characters or
	  simple logo).</li>
	<li>audio feedback when operating the touch screen</li>
	<li>should allow adding extra peripherals in future, e.g.
	  <ul>
	    <li>compact flash or smart media card reader</li>
	    <li>USB printers</li>
	    <li>bar code reader</li>
	  </ul>
	</li>
      </ul>
      2. Implementation:
      <p>
	The BB Depot is implemented using a standard low-cost
	Intel-based PC running GatewayOS.  The reasons for switching
	from the existing SME hardware are:
	<ul>
	  <li>to support the touch screen display on an SME box we
	    need to 
	    implement a graphic card and serial input, which requires
	    board changes.</li>
	  <li>adding new peripherals to a PC usually requires
	    inserting a PCI card, but for the SME we might need a
	    board change or custom-designed mini-pci card.</li>
	  <li>device drivers are more readily available for Intel than
	    PowerPC.</li>
	  <li>we need the ability to add peripherals to the Depot
	    without hardware modification.</li>
	  <li>porting GatewayOS to a PC should be relatively easy:
	    the only non-trivial changes are the way we handle
	    configuration variables and software upgrade, which should
	    now go to the hard disk instead of the flash.</li>
 	</ul>
      </p>
      <p>We will need a custom enclosure with the touch-screen display
	and the BB flash card connector mounted on it.  We probably
	need some removable front panels for future add-ons.</p>
      <h4>Download Station</h4>
      1. Requirements:
      <ul>
	<li>a small color display</li>
	<li>a simple input device</li>
	<li>a connector for the BB memory module</li>
	<li>very robust, industrial-strength enclosure</li>
	<li>connect to the main module via USB</li>
      </ul>	
      2. Implementation:
      <p>A download station is simply a standard TV and a BB
	controller permanently mounted onto the same enclosure (sort of like
	an arcade game console).  This controller is connected to the
	Depot's main module via USB.  We probably also want and
	extension cable to pull out the memory module connectors to
	the front of the download station.</p>
      <p>A download station is acted as a "generic" BB player, which
	does not contain a digital ID (and so, cannot play game).
	They run only one application, which is the content download program.</p>
