      <h3><span style="background-color: #C0C0C0">BB Player Purchase</span></h3>
<p><b>Description: </b>Customer purchases BB player, and gets any free content associated with the purchase of the BB.</p>
<p><b>Rationale</b></p>
<ol>
  <li>Ensure that only officially manufactured BB units are sold through BB Depots and can subsequently
    purchase content (i.e. eTickets).</li>
  <li>Promotional/free content eTicket will be issued at the time of the BB
    Player purchase. This content may change from time to time based on marketing
    promotions and therefore cannot be fixed at the time of manufacture.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;<b>Assumptions &amp; conditions</b></p>
<ol>
  <li>Customer may not return free content for refunds or cash.</li>
  <li>Operator/Retailer has authenticated depot to the server using depotID.</li>
</ol>
<p><b>Sequence of events/actions</b></p>
      <ol>
	<li>Customer - selects or hands over BB Player to Retailer and asks to
      purchase BB &amp; get Free Content</li>
	<li>Retailer - selects <i> BB Purchase</i> option in Retail Application
      &amp; is prompted to connect the BB Player</li>
	<li>Retailer - connect special USB cable to new BB player, through
	  a "hole" in the box.</li>
	<li>Retailer - starts the purchase process</li>
	<li>Retailer - when the display shows completion of purchase process,
      retailer unplugs the cable and hand the BB player to
	  customer. Customer is directed to go to the download station to get his
      free game.</li>
	<li>Customer proceeds to download station and goes through with
      &quot;Content Download&quot;</li>
      </ol>

      <h3><span style="background-color: #C0C0C0">BB Player Return</span></h3>
<p><b>Description: </b>Customer returns a recently purchased BB Player.</p>
<p><b>Rationale</b></p>
<ol>
  <li>Provides the retailer with an option to return a recently purchased but unused BB Players back into
    the stock in case of any erroneous purchases.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;<b>Assumptions &amp; conditions</b></p>
<ol>
  <li>After a BB Player has been purchased, a customer has up to 30 minutes during which
    it may be returned for a refund. This forces the customer to learn our
    process right away by following through with the content download soon after
    purchase and limits inventory accounting issues if returns were not subject
    to a time limit.</li>
  <li>Returns will also not be permitted if the eTicket associated with the free
    content is downloaded from the servers or any other eTickets associated with
    other content is downloaded to the BB.</li>
  <li>Operator/Retailer has authenticated depot to the server using depotID.</li>
</ol>
<p><b>Sequence of events/actions</b></p>
<ol>
	<li>Customer - hands over BB Player to Retailer and asks to return BB</li>
	<li>Retailer - selects <i>BB Player Return</i> option in Retail Application
      &amp; is prompted to connect the BB Player</li>
	<li>Retailer - connect special USB cable to new BB player, through
	  a "hole" in the box.</li>
	<li>Retailer - starts the return process</li>
	<li>Retailer - if return process is successful, puts BB Player back on
      display and refunds customer the amount of purchase. If the return process
      is unsuccessful, disconnects and returns BB Player back to customer.</li>
</ol>
<hr>
      
      <h3><span style="background-color: #C0C0C0">eTicket Purchase</span></h3>
<p><b>Description: </b>Customer wants to purchase additional content.</p>
<p><b>Rationale</b></p>
<ol>
  <li>eTicket i.e. content license is individualized for the BB Player. Possession of
    content does not indicate ownership.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<p><b>Assumptions &amp; conditions</b></p>
<ol>
  <li>Customer has purchased a BB Player and he has a formatted BB Card.</li>
  <li>Customer needs only the BB Card - since this contains his BB Player's
    Digital Certificate (DC). The DC has the public key of the BB Player and a
    unique
    BBID.</li>
  <li>The BB Card identifies (does not authenticate) the BB Player for which the
    eTicket will be issued.</li>
  <li>Operator/Retailer has authenticated depot to the server using depotID.</li>
</ol>
<p><b>Sequence of events/actions</b></p>
	<ol>
	  <li>Customer - selects a content/game title from a brochure or other
        material for which he wants to get the eTicket</li>
	  <li>Customer - hands over his BB player's BB
        Card to the Retailer along with the money &amp; indicates the content</li>
	  <li>Retailer - selects <i>Purchase eTicket </i>option from the Retail
        Application</li>
	  <li>Retailer - upon being prompted, plugs in the BB Card into the BB Depot</li>
	  <li>Retailer - upon successful purchase
	    returns the BB Card to the customer &amp; asks the customer to go to the
        download station to download his content.</li>
	  <li>Customer - walks over to the download station, inserts the BB Card.</li>
	  <li>Customer - reviews display which shows all the content for which he
        has eTickets, associated with his BB Player as
        identified by the BB Card.</li>
	  <li>Customer - selects the content he wants to download,
	    confirms the selection, and
	    removes the BB Card when the transaction is
	    complete.  </li>
	</ol>
<hr>
      
      <h3><span style="background-color: #C0C0C0"> eTicket Refund</span></h3>
<p><b>Description: </b>Permit the customer to get his money back for an unused
eTicket which was purchased by Retailer error.</p>
<p><b>Rationale</b></p>
<ol>
  <li>The Retailer&nbsp; may have made a mistake during the eTicket Purchase
    process or the customer may have changed his mind about the purchase.</li>
</ol>
<p><b>Assumptions &amp; conditions</b></p>
<ol>
  <li>A refund will not be permitted if the eTicket is downloaded from the
    server into the BB Card.</li>
  <li>The customer also has only 30 minutes after the purchase of an eTicket to
    get a refund. This is to limit the exposure we have where another customer#2
    with a BB Card that contains the BB identification of customer#1's BB Player
    asks for a refund of a recently purchased eTicket.</li>
  <li>The BB Player identified by the BB Card has recently purchased an eTicket.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>The server always has the complete information about the BB Player &amp;
    eTickets that are owned by it.</li>
  <li>The BB Card identifies (does not authenticate) the BB Player for which the
    eTicket has been.</li>
  <li>Retailer has authenticated depot to the server using depotID.</li>
</ol>
<p><b>Sequence of events/actions</b></p>
	<ol>
	  <li>Customer - indicates that he wants an eTicket refund, hands over the BB Card and identifies to the
        Retailer the
        content.</li>
	  <li>Retailer -&nbsp; selects the <i> eTicket Refund</i> option from the
        Retail Application and selects the eTicket in question</li>
	  <li>Retailer - receives confirmation from the server that eTicket refund
        may be issued since the conditions for refund have been met</li>
	  <li>Retailer - confirms eTicket refund and amount of purchase</li>
	  <li>Retailer - waits for transaction to complete and hands over the BB
        Card and the money to the customer</li>
	</ol>
<hr>

      <h3><span style="background-color: #C0C0C0">Content Download</span></h3>
<p><b>Description: </b>Customer's BB Player owns eTickets and he wants to
download the associated content into the BB Card.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Rationale</b></p>
<ol>
  <li>Customer may own a large number of eTickets, but have space for a limited
    number of content on his BB Card. So, he may constantly be deleting and
    reloading content into the BB Card.</li>
  <li>Content download is a separate action from
    eTicket Purchase, since this may take a slightly longer period of
    time.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<p><b>Assumptions &amp; conditions</b></p>
<ol>
  <li>The BB Card identifies (does not authenticate) the BB Player for which the
    eTicket has been. The actual BB Player does not need to be present.</li>
  <li>The BB Player owns at least one eTicket which identifies the content.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Retailer does not have to authenticate the depot the the server.</li>
</ol>
<p><b>Sequence of events/actions</b></p>
      <ol>
	<li>Customer - inserts his BB Card into the download station</li>
	<li>Customer - reviews all owned eTickets</li>
	<li>Customer - using&nbsp; the BB controller on the download station, customer
	  selects content to be downloaded.</li>
	<li>Customer - waits for the display to indicate completion of the download
      process</li>
	<li>Customer - repeats this process for all content that he is interested in
      that he owns</li>
	<li>Customer - removes BB Card.</li>
      </ol>

      <hr>
      <h3><span style="background-color: #C0C0C0">Purchase expansion memory for

<p><b>Assumptions &amp; conditions</b></p>
<ol>
