<h3>1. Overview</h3>

This document describes abstraction of data stored in BB server repositories
and data exchange amongst BB server components, BB Depot and BB devices.
Main focus of this document is to supplement the
"<a href="bbserver_arch.html">BB Servers - Architectural Scoping Document</a>"
document on abstracting flows of data amongst components. It also defines
ownership of data element which would be duplicated in multiple repositories.
Abstraction is used so that it can be isolated from what mechanism to transfer
these data or how components are implemented, which are mostly irrelevant
from high level data flow perspective.
<br>
Refer to protocol and secure infrastructure documents on
how these data is securely transferred between components. Also refer to
"<a href="bbserver_repository.html">BB Servers - Repositories</a>"
for actual database schema and physical layout in detail.
<p>
BB system has multiple streams of data flow for the following:
<ul>
  <li><b>Content Distribution</b><br>
     This is the data stream from Studio (Developers) to BB devices via
	 BB servers and BB Depot for content distribution. All content will be
	 distributed securely over this stream.
  <li><b>eTicket Issuance</b><br>
     This is the data stream from BB device manufactures to BB devices via
	 BB servers and BB Depot for eTicket issuance. Actual eTicket production
	 happens in Operation Center. All eTickets will be issued and delivered
	 securely over this stream.
  <li><b>Inventory Management</b><br>
     This is the data stream from BB Depot to BB servers for inventory
	 record and management. All sales records entered in BB Depot will
	 be sent over this stream.
  <li><b>Remote Management</b><br>
     This is the same as what RMS and SME device does, and not described
	 in this document.
  <li><b>Activity Auditing</b><br>
     This is the data stream from BB and BB Depot to BB servers for
	 auditing of activities. Some data to be sent are not particularly
	 for auditing, like data described above.  
</ul>

<h3>2. Data in Repositories</h3>

This section describes major data stored in each repository. 
Refer to the "<a href="bbserver_arch.html">BB Servers - Architectural Scoping Document</a>"
document for roles of repositories and terminologies.

<h4>2.1 Master Content DB</h4>
<ul>
  <li><b>Master Content: file</b><br>
     Unencrypted master content file (game file) to be published. This form
	 of content cannot be played on BB device.
  <li><b>Master Content: metadata</b><br>
     Unecrypted metadata for the content to be published. Metadata will be
	 published along with the content file.
</ul>

<h4>2.2 RMS DB</h4>
<ul>
  <li><b>Gateway ID</b><br>
     Universally unique ID that identifies BB Depot. It is called "BB Depot ID"
	 in BB server documents.
  <li><b>IP address (indexed by Gateway ID)</b><br>
     IP address of given BB Depot ID. It may change over time, and need to
	 retrieve whenever BB Depot needs to be accessed.
</ul>

<h4>2.3 Studio DB</h4>
<ul>
  <li><b>Studio ID</b><br>
    Universally unique ID that identifies studio. Studio ID is generated and
	assigned when studio is signed up for content development.
  <li><b>Studio information (indexed by Studio ID)</b><br>
    Logistics information, like name, address, billing information, etc.
  <li><b>Studio signer certificate (indexed by Studio ID)</b><br>
    Certificate issued for the studio when it signed up for content development.
	This certificate is used solely for digital signature of content published
	by the studio. Its private key cannot be found anywhere in BB server
	repositories. It is stored only in DevKit.<br>
  <li><b>Security keys for content publishing</b><br>
    The type and index of security keys stored in this repository depends on
	what secure
	mechanism for content publishing from studio is. It may not even need to
	store keys in this repository. (Refer to Security Infrastructure document
	for detail)
  <li><b>Activity records of studio (indexed by Studio ID & sequence number)</b><br>
    All communications between Operation Center and Studio will be recorded
	for auditing purpose. The following is the activities which will be recorded,
	but not limited to:
	<ul>
	  <li>DevKit validation request
	  <li>Issue of signer certificate
	  <li>Content publishing request
	  <li>Content publishing (success or faill; ip address of publisher)
	</ul>
</ul>

<h4>2.4 Content DB</h4>
<ul>
  <li><b>Title ID</b><br>
    This is the ID that will be published to BB users and retailers for them
	to specify title for purchasing.<br>
	Title ID is generated and assigned manually by Operation Center when new
	title is registered to publish.
  <li><b>Title Name (indexed by Title ID)</b><br>
    Name of the title extracted from the metadata during content publishing
	process. This is used solely for user interface, like BB server management
	console. Updated content will replace this record.
  <li><b>Title Description (indexed by Title ID)</b><br>
    Description of the title extracted from the metadata during content publishing
	process. This is used solely for user interface, like BB server management
	console. Updated content will replace this record.
  <li><b>Content ID (indexed by Title ID)</b><br>
    Universally unique ID that identifies content. Content ID is generated and
	assigned automatically by Content Publishing Server when the content is
	published by studio. There would be multiple Content ID per Title ID in case
	the content is updated due to bug fixes.<br>
	Unlike Title ID, Content ID is unknown to studio.
  <li><b>Encrypted content file (indexed by Content ID)</b><br>
    Encrypted content file (game file) to be distributed. This form of content
	can be played on BB device, and therefore, need to be protected. The secret
	key used to encrypt the file will be same for multiple revision of content
	so that it will not affect eTicket generation process for this content.<br>
	The secret key cannot be found in this repository.<br>
	<b><i>Issue: what to do for the secret key compromised</i></b>
  <li><b>Metadata (indexed by Content ID)</b><br>
    Metadata will not be encrypted.<br>
	Metadata contains a set of data to be used to construct a catalog on
	Operation Center as well as on BB Depot:
	  <ul>
	    <li>Title (support multibyte characters)
		<li>Description (support multibyte characters)
		<li>Size (in bytes)
		<li>Studio ID
		<li>Proxy file (image file for display in catalog)
		<li>Release date
		<li>Version
		<li>Price (?)
		<li>e.t.c.
	  </ul>
</ul>

<h4>2.5 BB DB</h4>

	 Center).
  <li><b>Public key (owned; indexed by BB ID)</b><br>
     Publik key for individual BB will be uploaded from manufacture (or generated
	 within Operation Center). No encryption required.
  <li><b>(Owner information)</b><br>
     TBD
</ul>

<h4>2.6 BB Depot Account DB</h4>

<ul>
  <li><b>Account ID</b><br>
     Account ID, or Retailer ID is generated when a retailer signs up to sell

     All BB player and BB option sale transaction made via the retailer's
	 BB Depot will be recorded. The retailer is responsible to pay the price
	 for sold devices.
	 Due to a delay caused by the deffered transactions,
	 the records may not be updated realtime. These record will also be
	 examined for auditing purpose.
  <li><b>BB inventory record (indexed by Account ID)</b><br>
     BB player and BB option inventory that the retailer supposed to have at
	 given point in time. This record will be used to determine when and what
	 devices need to be shipped to the retailer, or used to decide whether to
	 send new devices to the retailer. Unless this record indicate that the
	 retailer is running out of devices, no shipment should be done.
  <li><b>Content sales record (indexed by Account ID)</b><br>
     All content sale transactions made via the retailer's BB Depot will be
	 recorded. The retailer is responsible to pay the price for sold content.
	 Due to a delay caused by the deffered transactions,

	 examined for auditing purpose.
</ul>

<h4>2.7 eTicket DB</h4>
<ul>
  <li><b>Content Encryption Key (indexed by Content ID)</b><br>
     Content Encryption key is generated when content is published (re-encryption)
	 and stored into Content DB. The key for the re-encryption is encrypted by
	 a public key of eTicket Transaction server and stored into this repository.
	 Therefore, it can be used only by the server.
  <li><b>BB player public key (copied from BB DB)</b><br>
     When "activation" request comes from BB player, its public key is retrieved
	 and copied from BB DB.<br>
	 (TBD: should this repository the owner of BB player public key ?)<br>
	 This is the key to encrypt eTicket for designated BB player device.
  <li><b>eTicket issuance record (indexed by BB ID)</b><br>
     All issuance of eTicket will be recorded for billing and auditing purpose.
	 The information will be delegated to BB DB and BB-Depot Account DB as
	 "deffered transaction."
</ul>


<h4>2.8 Hardware Inventory DB</h4>

	 This record will be a seed for delived records in other repositories.
  <li><b>BB option sales</b><br>
     Record BB option sold, date, BB-Depot Account ID for each sale of BB optoins.
	 This record will be a seed for delived records in other repositories.
  <li><b>BB-Depot interactions</b><br>
     BB-Depot will periodically send all interaction records that BB-Depot
	 operators made. All these interaction records will be logged in this
	 repository for later auditing.<br>
	 It may send immediate warning if obvious fraud is found.
</ul>
