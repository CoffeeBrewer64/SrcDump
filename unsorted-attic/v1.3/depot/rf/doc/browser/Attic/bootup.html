    We don't know yet exactly what activation steps are required. It is
    likely that an initial first app (browser) will be written to flash at the
    factory. This means that even though activation takes place at the depot,
    the first app can take care of this task, so it doesn't need to be a part
    of the SK startup logic.

    Recovery is needed when the first app (browser) on the flash has become
    damaged and unusable. The memory card is brought to the depot.
    Current thinking is the depot will have a special slot for memory cards
    that is used for both license purchase and recovery. In this case
    the BB only needs to detect that recovery is needed, and does not need
    to be capable of performing the recovery steps.
    <p>
    Other possibilities that have been discussed are getting a new memory
    module and swapping the removable portions from the old to new. In this
    case the SK doesn't have to do anything to support recovery. It is also
    possible to require a USB connection running a secure protocol. This would
    require some recovery steps to be implemented by the SK, such as a 
    protocol over USB and writing the new first app to flash. The SK would
    then launch the new first app which would continue with the recovery
    process.

This section describes the startup flow for the SK and browser. From
the SK startup it will be clear how the browser is launched. The browser
flow description will also indicate required entrypoints to the SK.
An effort is made to indicate when the same processing is required by
both the SK and browser tasks.

<i>Re-encrypt</i><br>
This decision could actually be made by attempting to launch an
app via the call SK_AppLaunch (below), and finding out from the
SK return value that re-encryption is required first.

<i>Recover</i><br>
If a content re-encryption was interrupted by a powerdown, a portion of the
content file will be re-encrypted, and a portion will still be in the
encryption according to the license "Content Decryption Key".  This block will
restore the state before powerdown, so the next block, "Loop block calls to
SK", can complete the re-encryption.  Therefore, the next block, "Loop block
calls to SK", must be carried out such that recovery is possible.

The main advantage of a secondary, smaller boostrapable app between the
browser and SK is to make the SK's job of locating the first app easier.
The new boostrap app would be small and located in the first few blocks.
To locate the browser, the SK needs to know some FS info. The code to
locate the browser should be pretty simple though, so it isn't clear
we'd really benefit from a secondary bootstrap step at this point.
