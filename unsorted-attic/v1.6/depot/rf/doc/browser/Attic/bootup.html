The goals of this document are to:
d21 3
a23 4
  <li> partition tasks between boot-code (in secure ROM), secure kernel (SK)
       code (in secure SRAM), and browser application (BA) code (in DRAM).
       From this, detailed sizing efforts can be undertaken for code that
       needs to reside in ROM and secure SRAM.
d27 10
a36 7
A high level view of the startup sequence and software partioning is provided
in Figure 1. At power-up the processor executes out of secure boot-ROM.
Boot-ROM contains a minimal amount of code to bootstrap the SK into secure
SRAM, from where it will be run. The SK must launch the BA, and relies on
libraries to accomplish this. Also in the libraries are functions implementing
services required by the BA. The BA runs from external DRAM and uses and NMI
request mechanism to request services from the SK.

<b>Re-encryption key packet:</b><br>
Because of the re-encryption process, there is additional data required to
run an application. This additional data is referred to as the "re-encryption
packet" and is stored in external flash. The packet contains the CID and
re-encryption key, and is encrypted with the destination BB's public key.


<h2>Tasks to be carried out</h2>

Before going into lower-level details and fully partioning tasks, high
level task descriptions are provided in this section.

    If an error occurs during this process recovery is required and the 
    error LED must be lit. There has been discussion regarding the need
    to write some sort of encrypted recovery packet containing the BBID
    to external flash, but this has been deemed unnecessary.

  <li> Content Download and Re-encryption: <br>
    If a re-encryption step is needed, it will always occur as part of the
    download process. The content playback license is used to determine if
    re-encryption is required, as described 
    <a href=#reencrypt_decide>earlier</a>.
    <p>
    When re-encryption is not required, the content download process 
    does not involve the SK. Even authentication of the memory module
    proceeds by having the BA directly forward the on-module BB cert
    to the depot. The content is downloaded from the depot and written
    to flash without requiring SK calls.
    <p>
    The overall download process is:

      <li> Locate and load license information from flash.
      <li> Use SK call to determine if re-encryption is necessary - 
           SK_RecryptReq(). If not, browser may proceed without more
	   SK API calls by downloading chunks and storing to flash.
	   Else, proceed to next bullet.
      <li> Download Re-encrypt license from depot.
      <li> Use the re-encryption data from the license to create a
           re-encryption key.
      <li> Download content blocks, continue hash verification, re-encrypt 
           using the new key, and store to flash. 
      <li> Verify computed hash over entire content versus the one in the 
           license over entire content.
      <li> Commit the content file to the FFS and write re-encryption packet
           (to be used for future playback).

This is the decision as to whether or not the entry was due to NMI.
To determine NMI, the CP_0 status register is first checked for the SR bit.
If this is set, then the secure mode register is read to determine if
NMI status is set. Due to the NMI precedence, all registers must be
saved to SRAM before they are used.

This block performs basic system initialization. Memory is checked and
all hardware registers requiring intialization are written. The CPU primary
data and instruction caches are invalidated. Coming from a hard reset, the
initialization could assume the boot-ROM has already performed some of the
initialization tasks, but these would need to be repeated in the case of soft
reset anyhow.

<i>Re-encrypt Key Exists</i><br>
Re-encryption is required if either it has never been started, or
it has been started and interrupted prior to completion. This decision
is to determine if re-encryption has never been started. Re-encryption
has never been started if the re-encryption key does not exist in the
re-encryption key list.
<p>
The list of re-encryption keys is co-managed by both the BA and SK: the
SK maintains the data while the BA manages storage. A call to the SK
function SK_ReencryptKeyExists(pLicense, pKeyList) can be used to
determine if the key has been created. The pLicense argument is a pointer
to the License, and the pKeyList argument is a pointer to the list of
re-encryption keys.
-->

<!--
d621 4
a624 21
<i>Create Re-encrypt Key</i><br>
The re-encryption key is created using the SK function:
<pre>
<font FACE="monospace">
   int SK_StartReencrypt(
               pLicense,      // IN: ptr to license data
               ppKeyList,     // IN/OUT: ptr to key list
               pKeyListLen,   // IN/OUT: ptr length of key list
               ppSkState,     // OUT: ptr to state used by SK_Reencrypt()
               SkStateOutLen  // OUT: length of data in ppSkState
	       );
</font>
</pre> 
Before the call, the ppKeyList argument is a pointer
to the re-encryption key list that has been loaded to memory. Upon
successful function completion the new key will be included in the
ppKeyList, pKeyListLen will reflect the new length,  and the BA will 
need to save the list the flash. The ppSkState argument is a pointer,
with memory allocated by the SK (BA must deallocate) to state information 
private to the SK. It will be used by the SK_Reencrypt() calls to follow.

<h3>Content Download Flow</h3>
Figure 6, below, depicts the content download depot flow referenced in 
Figure 5. As illustrated in Figure 5, this flow is entered when the user
decides to download content at the depot. Content re-encryption occurs
during this step as shown in the figure.

<b>Figure 6. Content Download Flow</b>

<p>
The elements of Figure 6 are described next.

<p>
<i>SK_RecryptReq</i> <br>
The SK API SK_RecryptReq is used to determine if re-encryption is
required for the content to be downloaded. The SK makes this determination
based on the license fields as described <a href=#reencrypt_decide>here</a>.

<p>
<i>Re-crypt</i><br>
This decision block is simply interpretting the result of the previous
call to SK_RecryptReq.

<p>
<i>Download Re-encrypt License</i><br>
When re-encryption is required, a license is needed to give this BB the 
right to personalize content for the BB indicated by the cert on flash.
This license is downloaded from the depot and placed in memory.

<p>
<i>SK_StartRecrypt</i><br>
The re-encryption process is started by using the SK API
SK_StartRecrypt() and passing in the personalization license downloaded
in the previous step.

<p>
<i>Download Content Chunk</i><br>
A chunk is downloaded for re-encryption. This chunk is at least as 
large as required for the SK_Recrypt() call that will follow. The
size is convenient from a network point of view.

<p>
<i>SK_Recrypt</i><br>
Re-encrypt a chunk of size appropriate for the SK API call SK_Recrypt().
This size is likely to be smaller than the download chunk size from 
the previous step.

<p>
<i>Chunk Done</i><br>
Check to see if the next content chunk needs to be downloaded.

<p>
<i>Flash Save</i><br>
If this the amount re-encrypted is the size of a Flash block, save
the chunk to flash. Do not adjust the FAT yet, since the end result
could be failure, so must save FAT chain for storage later.

<i>Content Done</i><br>

the content had a valid hash. If successful, move to next block, otherwise
the process stops with an error.
