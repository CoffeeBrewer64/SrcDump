	      BB Depot Architecture</a> for a current description.</font></i>
      </p>
      <p>
	This document describes the role of the BB Depot with respect
	to the rest of the BB Game Distribution System.  Please refer
	to <a href="bbserver_arch.html"><em>Architectural Scoping Document</em></a> 
	for a general description of the overall system.
      </p>
      <p>
	The fundamental design principle is that a BB Depot is not a
	trusted device.  It could be stolen, lost, misused, or subject
	to malicious attacks.  No critical data is ever stored in a BB
	Depot.
      </p>

      <h2>I. Hardware</h2>
      <p>
	Detailed design specification of the BB Depot hardware is to be
	provided by the hardware team (<em>who?</em>).  A
	high-level description of the requirements is provided here.
      </p>
      <h4>Main components</h4>
      <p>1. Main Module:
	<ul>
	  <li>mostly based on the current SME box with modifications.</li>
	  <li>need all 3 Ethernet connections: an uplink to the
	    Internet, a dedicated downlink for purchasing eTickets,
	    and another downlink for downloading content.</li>
	  <li>PCMCIA not needed</li>
	  <li>hard disk required, 20GB ok now, but might need to put
	    in larger capacity disk in future (any thermal issue?).</li>
	  <li>mini-PCI graphics card (for display device)</li>
	  <li>PS/2-based serial input</li>
	  <li>USB - not needed right now, but might be needed for
	    further expansion (e.g. printer)</li>
	</ul>
	<br>2. Console:
	<ul>
	  <li>small (e.g. 300x240 pixels) LCD, B&W ok.</li>
	  <li>needs to display Chinese characters (both simplified
	    and tranditional?) and low resolution graphics</li>
	  <li>membrane keypad with serial interface:
	    mostly numerical plus few function keys; should allow
	    upgrade by replacing membrane.</li>
	  <li>audio feedback when pressing keys</li>
	  <li>keypad should allow very heavy use</li>
	  <li>connector to BB device (for purchasing eTickets):
	    ideally should be in a form of a cradle into which the BB
	    can be slided in.  In any case, it should not be a
	    dangling cable.
	  </li>
	</ul>
	<br>3. Download Station:
	<ul>
	  <li>connect to the main module via standard Ethernet</li>
	  <li>multiple (4 to 8) connectors for BB</li>
	  <li>could be implemented as a standard 4-8 port Ethernet
	    hub with an Ethernet-to-BB converter for each port.</li>
	  <li>combined or separated power support for each
	    converter?</li>
	  <li>same cradle design for sitting the BB?</li>
	</ul>
	
      <h4>Enclosures</h4>
      <ul>
	<li>Each main component should be in a separate enclosure for
	  maximum placement flexibility.  </li>
	<li>Yet, we probably want them to be stackable on top of each
	  other for shops that are tight in space. </li>
	<li>The download station should be able to withstand lots of
	  physical abuse. If it is ever placed outdoor (like an
	  ATM machine facing the street), we need to consider rain,
	  dust, sand, etc.</li>
	<li>The download station could be connected with multiple BB
	  at the same time, so the BB connectors need to be separated
	  from each other with some minimal distance (i.e., we need to
	  leave enough room for the users to stand/sit next to each
	  other). </li>
	<li>Do we need a physical lock on the console (like those on a
	  cash register)?</li>
	<li>Connecting between the console and the main module are:
	  video signal, serial signal (input), Ethernet, power (if the
	  console does not have separate power supply).</li>
	<li>The main module and download station are connected via a
	  standard Ethernet cable.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>II. Network Configurations</h2>

      <p>
	The basic requirement is a broadband Internet connection (e.g,
	ADSL or cable modem) connected to the uplink of the BB Depot.
	No other network device other than the download station should
	be connected to the downlink of the BB Depot.  Multiple
	download station could share the download via a hub.  The BB
	Depot should be able to handle at least 12 connections.
      </p>
      <h4>Basic Configuration</h4>
      <ul>
	<li>dedicated broadband connection</li>
	<li>single BB Depot</li>
	<li>on "edge" of Internet (i.e., no router, firewall, or NAT
	  in front of the BB Depot).</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Multiple BB Depots</h4>
      <ul>
	<li>for very large shops that need more than one console for
	  eTicket transactions</li>
	<li>single dedicated broadband connection shared by all BB Depots.</li>
	<li>one of the BB Depots (master) sit on the edge of the Internet,
	  also serving as a router</li>
	<li>port forward RMS control to other BB Depots (slaves).</li>
	<li>slave BB Depots are connected to the master via a
	  standard Ethernet hub.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Shared Broadband Connection</h4>
      <ul>
	<li>for shops who want to share the broadband connection with
	  existing local network</li>
	<li>BB Depot no longer at the edge of the Internet, so we need
	  to port forward RMS control from the router to the BB Depot.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>III. Software Components</h2>

      <h4>Base System Software</h4>
      <ul>
	<li>based on the existing SME release (Gateway OS 2.4) with
	  most services removed</li>
	<li>no email, file share, web server, VPN, backup server,
	  printer server, or wireless network</li>
	<li>need multiple users support (for identifying console
	  operator)</li>
	<li>need LVM and journal file system</li>
	<li>need all standard router features: NAT, port forwarding,
	  firewall, dhcp (client and server), DNS, no bridging between
	  downlinks</li>
	<li>need remote management, sysmon, time service.</li>
	<li>remote management needs to be enhanced to handle multiple
	  BB Depots sharing the same connection.</li>
	<li>new device driver for console display, and for serial
	  input from keypad.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Content download</h4>
      <p>1. Requirements
	<ul>
	  <li>Content downloading is not a secure transaction --
	    security is guaranteed by encryption of content and
	    eTickets.</li>
	  <li>Can connect with multiple BB's at the same time</li>
	  <li>Can operate even when Internet connection is down, as
	    long as the title content is cached.</li>
	  <li>Does not involve shop owner</li>
	  <li><strike>BB and the BB Depot need to authenticate each
	    other</strike> BB needs to report its ID to the
	  server, though it is not needed to be authenticated.</li>
	  <li>BB Depot does not check for existence or validity of
	    the eTicket (it has no knowledge to check anyway).</li>
	  <li>It's the BB's responsibility to decide if it has
	    enough memory for the title to be downloaded.</li>
	  <li>BB Depot needs to provide size information of a title
	    upon request</li>
	  <li><strike>BB Depot could request BB to</strike>
	    BB should report the current memory layout (titles and
	    tag-along content loaded, free space, etc.) to BB Depot
	    before each download
	  </li>
	  <li>BB Depot may tag along additional content with the
	    requested title, if space is available.</li>
	  <li>BB Depot needs to log all title download transactions
	    and report periodically to the BB server (though not
	    necessarily in real time).</li>
	</ul>
      <p>2. Implementation
	<ul>
	  <li>Transparent Proxy
	    <ol type=i>
	      <li>As far as the BB is concerned, it is communicating
		directly with the BB server. This allows a BB connecting
		directly to the Internet to download content without going
		through a BB Depot (if we want to support it).  </li>
	      <li>BB Depot acts as a transparent caching proxy -- but
		modified to handle content download even when the
		connection to the server is down.</li>
	    </ol>
	  </li>
	  <li>Tag-Along Content
	    <ol type=i>
	      <li>additional information downloaded to the
	BB with a title content.  Typically this would
	be promotional information and the corresponding eTicket is
	free (and automatically downloaded).</li>
	      <li>Downloading of tag-along content is controlled by the BB
		Depot</li>
	      <li>The BB Depot decides which content to tag-along with the
		title content download, based on:
		<ul>
		  <li>BB id</li>
		  <li>title being downloaded</li>
		  <li>free space available</li>
		</ul>
	      </li>
	      <li>The BB Depot decides if old tag-along content should be
		removed.</li>
	      <li>Title content always have priority over tag-along
		content, i.e., tag-along content is automatically removed,
		if necessary, to make room for title content.</li>
	      <li>When showing the amount of free space on the BB's
		display, it should include the space taken by tag-along
		content.</li> 
	    </ol>
	  </li>
	  <li>Protocol
	    <ol type=i>
	      <li>user selects content to download, press button to
		initial connection</li>
	      <li>BB obtains IP address from BB Depot</li>
	      <li>BB uploads BB ID, title ID, and memory map to BB
		Server</li>
	      <li>BB Depot intercepts connection to BB Server</li>
	      <li>BB Depot determines local availability of content,
		verifies space requirement, selects tag-along
		content</li>
	      <li>BB Depot replies with descriptions of file(s) to be
		downloaded, followed by the actual content(s).</li>
	      <li>BB acknowledges receipt of file(s).</li>
	      <li>BB terminates connection, and notifies user that download is complete</li>
	    </ol>
	  </li>
	</ul>
      <h4>Online Transactions</h4>
      <p>
	All online transactions involve three parties: the BB server, the BB
	Depot, and the BB device.  All three parties must be online
	when a transaction is taken place.  In addition, access to the BB Depot
	console must be protected (by user id/password).  Note that
	confidential information is passed directly between the BB
	device and the BB server, without first going through the BB Depot.
      </p>
      <p>
	Communications between these parties must satisfy the
	following requirements: 
	<ul>
	  <li>Mutual Authentication:
	    <ol type=i>
	      <li>BB Depot and BB server must authenticate each
		other.</li>
	      <li>BB and BB server must authenticate each other,
		independent of the BB Depot.</li>
	      <li>BB and BB Depot need not authenticate each other.</li>
	    </ol>
	  </li>
	  <li>Confidentiality:
	    <ol type=i>
	      <li>we need two end-point to end-point security: between
		the BB Depot and the BB server, and between the BB and
		the BB server.</li>
	      <li>communication between the BB and BB server must be
		kept secret from the BB Depot</li>
	      <li>connection between BB and BB Depot needs not be
		protected.</li> 
	    </ol>
	  </li>
	  <li>Non-repudiation:
	    <ol type=i>
	      <li>each transaction recorded by the BB server must bind
		the transaction data, the BB Depot, and the BB
		together.</li>
	      <li>a shop owner cannot repudiate a transaction (via use
		of digital signature).</li>
	    </ol>
	  </li>
	  <li>Data Integrity:
	    <ol type=i>
	      <li>each transaction will have a well-defined completion
		point</li>
	      <li>incomplete transaction must guarantee a consistent
		state between the BB and the BB server (e.g., BB
		cannot receive a valid eTicket while the BB server
		thinks the eTicket has been delivered).</li>
	    </ol>
	  </li>
	</ul>
	Currently, four online transactions are defined:

      <p>1. Purchase eTicket
	<ul>
	  <li>Protocol
	    <ol type=i>
	      <li>BB connects to BB Depot, and reports its ID</li>
	      <li>operator selects title from BB Depot console</li>
	      <li>BB Depot connects to BB server, authenticates each
		other and set up encryption key</li>
	      <li>BB Depot requests eTickets: sends ID of selected title, BB
		ID, and signature of the request message</li>
	      <li>BB server approves purchase (see <em>Policy</em>
		below), records purchase request, returns a
		temporary ID of this request, and close connection</li>
	      <li>BB Depot forward this request ID to BB</li>
	      <li>BB connects to BB server, authenticates each other,
		and set up encryption key</li>
	      <li>BB sends to BB server: request ID and BB ID (and
		certificate, which include its public key)</li>
	      <li>BB server lookup the request based using the request
		ID, validate the BB ID and generates eTicket for this BB</li>
	      <li>BB server encrypts eTicket with a random symmetric
		key and sends the encrypted eTicket to BB</li>
	      <li>BB acknowledges receipt of eTicket</li>
	      <li>BB server receives acknowledgement, marks the
		transaction as completed, sends the decryption key
		to BB, and close connection</li>
	      <li>BB receives decryption key, decrypts the eTicket,
		saves it to flash, and notifies BB Depot</li>
	      <li>BB Depot closes connection with BB, indicates on the
		console that the transaction completes.</li>
	    </ol>
	  </li>
	  <li>Policy
	    <ol type=i>
	      <li>each BB Depot has an associated account with the BB
		server, and a credit balance.  Approval of purchase request is
		based on the current balance.</li>
	      <li>BB server could reject purchase request based on
		other reasons, e.g., BB has not been activated, the
		content of the corresponding title has not been
		downloaded to the BB Depot, or the BB is on a on
		black-listed.</li> 
	      <li>purchase request expires after a short period of
		time if the BB does not download the eTicket</li>
	    </ol>
	  </li>
	  <li>Error Recovery
	    <ol type=i>
	      <li>once the BB server receives ack. from the BB for
		receiving the eTicket, the transaction is considered
		complete</li>
	      <li>if connection drops before transaction completion,
		it needs to be restarted.</li>
	      <li>if connection drops after transaction completion,
		and the purchase request restarted, only the
		decryption key of the eTicket will be returned.</li> 
	    </ol>
	  </li>
	</ul>

      <p>2. Activate a BB
	<ul>
	  <li>Protocol
	    <ol type=i>
	      <li>BB connects to BB Depot, and reports its ID</li>
	      <li>BB Depot connects to BB server, authenticates each
		other and set up encryption key</li>
	      <li>BB Depot requests BB activation: sends BB ID, and
		signature of the request message</li>
	      <li>BB server approves activation (see <em>Policy</em>
		below), returns ok, and wait for BB's connection</li>
	      <li>BB Depot tells BB to connect to BB server</li>
	      <li>BB connects to BB server and authenticates each other.</li>
	      <li>BB server validate BB's ID, record in the database
		that this BB has been activated, and close
		connection.  Transaction is considered complete at
		this point.</li>
	      <li>BB server tells BB Depot that activation is
		complete, and close connection</li>
	      <li>BB Depot indicates on the
		console that the transaction completes.</li>
	    </ol>
	  </li>
	  <li>Policy
	    <ol type=i>
	      <li>BB must not be previously activated.</li>
	      <li>BB ID must be a valid ID as supplied by the manufacturer</li>
	      <li>BB Depot must have a positive account balance.</li>
	      <li>A shopper owner could pre-activate BB
		devices, as long as s/he is willing to pay for them.
		Note that a BB cannot be deactivated after a short
		period of time (see BB deactivation below).</li>
	    </ol>
	  </li>
	</ul>

      <p>3. Revoke eTicket
	<ul>
	  <li>Protocol
	    <ol type=i>
	      <li>BB connects to BB Depot, and reports its ID, and
		list of all eTickets</li>
	      <li>operator selects title from BB Depot console to be revoked</li>
	      <li>BB Depot connects to BB server, authenticates each
		other and set up encryption key</li>
	      <li>BB Depot requests eTickets revocation: sends eTickets ID, BB
		ID, and signature of the request message</li>
	      <li>BB server approves revocation (see <em>Policy</em>
		below), records revocation request, and returns approval
		status to BB Depot</li>
	      <li>BB Depot tell BB to connect to BB server </li>
	      <li>BB connects to BB server, authenticates each other,
		and set up encryption key</li>
	      <li>BB server sends revocation instruction to BB</li>
	      <li>BB erases corresponding eTicket, tells BB server
		that the eTicket has been erased, and close connection</li>
	      <li>BB server marks eTicket has been revoked, marks the
		transaction as completed, notify BB Depot, and close
		connection.</li>
	      <li>BB Depot indicates on the console that the
		transaction completes.</li> 
	    </ol>
	  </li>
	  <li>Policy
	    <ol type=i>
	      <li>eTicket cannot be revoked if corresponding purchase
		record does not exist</li>
	      <li>an eTicket can be revoked only if it has been
		purchased for a short period of time (e.g., 30
		mins).  This is to prevent unauthorized game rental.</li>
	      <li>BB Depot that requests the revocation must be the
		same one that was used for the purchase, or if they
		are different, they must be owned by the same account holder.</li>
	    </ol>
	  </li>
	</ul>

      <p>4. Deactivate a BB
	<ul>
	  <li>Protocol<br>
	      Same as BB activation, except that the activation
	      request is changed to deactivation request.</br></li>
	  <li>Policy
	    <ol type=i>
	      <li>only activated BB can be deactivated.</li>
	      <li>only BB that was activated within a short period of
		time can be deactivated (e.g., 30 mins).</li>
	      <li>BB Depot that requests the deactivation must be the
		same one that was used for the activation, or if they
		are different, they must be owned by the same account holder.</li>
	    </ol>
	  </li>
	</ul>

      <h4>Offline Transaction</h4>
      <p>Sales of hardware options is not an online transaction and
	these devices are not individually trackable (they have no
	electronic IDs).  These transactions are not part of the
	online game distribution system.</p>
      <strong>Issue:</strong>  We could use the BB Depot to record sales and
      keep track of inventory.  However, there is no easy way to
      enforce that.
      
      <h4>New Title Release</h4>
      <p>1. Requirement
	<ul>
	  <li>All new title and tag-along content are pushed from the
	    Content Distribution Server down to the BB Depot.</li>
	  <li>Mutual authentication is required, but encryption is not
	    needed (each content is individually encrypted).</li>
	  <li>Each BB Depot should reserve a certain amount of disk
	    space for content, and report the disk utilization to the BB
	    server.</li>
	  <li>Selection of titles to download (and remove) is controlled
	    by the BB server.</li> 
	  <li>Each BB Depot should contain a complete
	    collection of all titles.</li>
	  <li>BB Depot should report title download statistics to the BB
	    server</li>
	</ul>
      <p>2.Issues
	<ul>
	  <li>Should we support BB Depots with different disk
	    sizes?</li>
	  <li>When will the total volume of content exceed the disk
	    capacity of a BB Depot (or some of them with smaller 
	    disk)?  
	  </li>
	</ul>

      <h4>Activity Monitor</h4>

      <p>
	Since the BB Depot is not a trusted device, we need to look out
	for any malicious activities.  A BB Depot must
	periodically reports all activities to the BB server for
	auditing.  If a BB Depot fails to report within a specific
	time, or if it shows abnormal activities, an alert should be
	raised.
      </p>
      <p>The kind of activities to be monitored should include, but
	not limited to:
	<ol>
	  <li>network activities through the <em>eTicket</em> port
	    (e.g., network traffic outside of normal business hours,
	    excessive traffic compared to the number of transactions).</li>
	  <li>activities at the BB Depot console (e.g., log in/log out
	  time for each sales person).</li>
	  <li>frequent request for eTicket revocation</li>
	  <li>prolonged down time</li>
	  <li>frequent switching of IP address</li>
	  <li>available disk space </li>
	</ol>
