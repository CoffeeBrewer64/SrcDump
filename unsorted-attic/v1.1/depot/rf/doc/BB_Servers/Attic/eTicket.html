      <h4>Transfering SC for another game</h4>
d119 9

	The binding between the SC and the game title could be
	changed.  However, this can be done only through the BB Depot
	specified in the SC record.
	For example, if the shop owner makes
	a mistake and requests a wrong title for the customer, or if
	the customer changes his mind before downloading the eTicket,
	the shop owner could request a <em>title transfer</em>, which
	effectively changes the "game title ID" in the SC record to a
	new one.
      </p>
      <p>
	The reason why only a BB Depot can change the game title is
	again to prevent a malicious user from changing a customer's
	purchase selections, as described above.  
	Note that this scheme
	assumes that a BB Depot's ID (i.e., it's certificate and private
	key) cannot be stolen or duplicated.  We propose storing such
	information in a smart card or some removable, secure media
	which is required to activate a BB Depot.
      </p>
      <p>
	The reason why the customer must go to the original BB Depot
	for a title transfer is a restriction implied by the refund
	policy.  When a customer wants to transfer a SC to a cheaper
	game, he would result with a credit balance and is entitled
	for a refund.  Our refund policy dictates that this must be
	down through the Depot that makes the original sale.  The time
	limit set by the refund policy also applies to title transfer.

	Since the BB ID is the only piece of information needed in
	purchasing store credits, providing <em>gift certificates</em>
	would be as easy as putting store credits into the right BB
	account.  However, memorizing the account number (i.e.,
	BB ID) is impractical for the customers.  It has been
	suggested that we could allow each customer to specify a
	human-friendly alias (such as their names, birthday, etc.).
	However, it would require the Depot operator to enter this
	alias to the console.  And we have decided that the operator
	might not be able to handle a full keyboard, not to mention
	entering Chinese characters.
      </p>
      <p>
	Another possibility is to issue gift certificates that are not
	bound to any specific BB.  To simplify matters, we could issue
	pre-printed gift certificates of fixed denominations.  When a
	customer purchase a gift cert., the shop  owner activates the
	cert by entering an ID number printed on it.  Upon
	activation, we deduct the correct amount of money from the
	Depot's account and record the ID number.  The recipient
	redeems the gift cert by presenting the memory module with the
	certificate to a shop owner.  The gift amount is then
	transferred to the corresponding BB account.
      </p>
      <p>
	The vulnerability of this scheme is between the time a
	cert. is activated and it is redeemed.  It is as safe as any
	common gift certificate used in many retail stores.  We need
	to make the ID number hard to guess.  However, we cannot
	prevent a malicious shop owner from stealing gift cert. he
	sold and putting the credits into another BB account, though
	he could not get cash out from the system.
