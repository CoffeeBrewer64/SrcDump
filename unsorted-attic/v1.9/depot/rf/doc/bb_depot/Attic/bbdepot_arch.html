      <h2>I. Hardware</h2>
      <p>

      </p>

      <h2>II. Design Principles</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>The BB Depot is not a trusted device. It could be stolen, lost,
          misused, or subject to malicious attacks.</li>
        <li>A secure transaction is one that usually involves some kind of goods
          or cash transfer. It must be possible to replace an existing BB Depot
          without losing any secure transaction data. This usually means that
          the connection to the Infrastructure/Server complex must be available
          during a secure transaction and the transaction data must be persisted
          on the server side.</li>
        <li>A hardware token (known as depotID) is used to authenticate the BB
          Depot to the Infrastructure/Server complex for secure transactions.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>III. Software Components</h2>
      <h4>Main Module</h4>
      <ul>
	<li>based on GatewayOS with most services removed</li>
	<li>no email, fileshare, web server, VPN, backup server,
	  printer server, or wireless network</li>
	<li>need multiple users support (for identifying console operator)</li>
	<li>need LVM and journal file system</li>
	<li>no network edge features are needed since this will be provided by the
      broadband modem - NAT, port forwarding, DHCP server, DNS,
      firewall</li>
	<li>network feature needed: DHCP client</li>
	<li>configuration could now be done via the console display
	  (i.e., no apache)</li>
	<li>need remote management (including remote console), Sysmon, time service</li>
	<li>drivers for touch screen display, USB connections with BB
	  player, BB Card Port for reading/writing BB Card</li>
	<li>secure communication with server</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Download Station</h4>
      <ul>
	<li>special apps for content download</li>
	<li>possibly run a demo program while not in used</li>
	<li>loading of demo program controlled by Depot</li>
      </ul>
