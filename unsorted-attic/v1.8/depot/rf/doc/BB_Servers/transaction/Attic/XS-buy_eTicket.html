      <h3>Output parameters</h3>
      <ol>
	<li><code>status</code></li>
	<li><code>eTicket</code></li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Sequence of events</h3>
      <ol>
	<li><code>readID</code>
	  <ol type=a>
	    <li><em>Retail App</em> reads from the <em>BB Card</em>
	      its <code>BB_ID</code></li>
	  </ol>
	</li>
	<li><code>authenticate</code>
	  <ol type=a>
	    <li><em>Retail App</em> connects to <em>eTicket Server</em></li>
	    <li>mutually verifies each other's identity</li>
	    <li>establishes secure communication link</li>
	  </ol>
	</li>
	<li><code>buyTicket</code>
	  <ol type=a>
	    <li><em>Retail App</em> requests for a new eTicket, passing
	      along the <code>BB_ID</code> and the
	      <code>Content_ID</code> (The <code>DepotID</code>
	      has already passed to the Server as a side-effect of the
	      authentication step.)</li> 
	    <li><em>eTicket Server</em> approves the sale:
	      <ol type=i>
		<li>reads from the BB Record that the BB Player has
		  been activated.</li>
		<li>reads from the eTicket Record that the BB does not
		  already own an eTicket for that content.</li>
		<li>reads from the Content Metadata and verifies that
		  this content is <code>purchasable</code>.</li>
		<li>reads from the Content Metadata the sale price of
		  this eTicket.</li>
		<li>reads from the Depot Record the commission code
		  for that store (which gives the actual price we
		  charge the store), and that the store has enough
		  balance to cover the sale.</li>
	      </ol>
	    </li>
	    <li><em>eTicket Server</em> updates the database:
	      <ol type=i>
		<li>generates a eTicket Record with the specified
		  <code>BB_ID</code>, <code>Content_ID</code>, the
		  current time and date.
		</li>
		<li>generates a corresponding Transaction Record.
		  In particular, records the <code>DepotID</code>
		  and the amount we withdraw from the store's
		  account.</li>
		<li>updates the balance in the Depot Record</li>
	      </ol>
	      The purchase is considered complete when all three
	      records records are saved in the database.  The above
	      operation must be atomic. 
	    </li>
	    <li><em>eTicket Server</em> generates the eTicket and
	      returns it with "success" status to the <em>Retail App</em>.
	    </li>
	  </ol>
	  <strong>Note:</strong> The balance of a Depot is
	  synchronized with the <em>Billing/Account Management</em>
	  system periodically (probably daily) and thus might not
	  reflect the true balance at the time of sale.
	</li>
	<li><code>storeTicket</code>
	  <ol type=a>
	    <li><em>Retail App</em> stores the eTicket to the <em>BB Card</em></li>
	  </ol>
	</li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Post-conditions</h3>
      <ol>
	<li>A new eTicket Record and Transaction Record are created
	  indicating the sale.</li>
	<li>The balance of the Depot is updated.</li>
	<li>The BB Card contains the new eTicket.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Audit Records</h3>
      <ol>
	<li>Purchase eTicket Request - <code>DepotID</code>,
	  <code>BB_ID</code>, <code>Content_ID</code>,
	  <code>date</code>, approval status.</li>
      </ol>
	  
      <h3>Exceptions</h3>

      <ol>
	<li><code>BB_ID</code> cannot be read from <em>BB Card</em> --
	  the BB Card might be uninitialized or broken.</li>
	<li>Secure connection cannot be established - the <em>Retail
	    App</em> needs to provide reason(s) of failure.</li>
	<li>The purchase request is not approved:
	  <ol type=a>
	    <li><code>BB_ID</code> not activated, or it has been
	      suspended or retired.</li>
	    <li>The BB Depot is black listed.</li>
	    <li>The BB Depot does not have enough credit to cover this
	      sale</li>
	    <li>Internal server error, e.g., database failure, backend
	      server crashed, etc.</li>
	  </ol>
	</li>
	<li>The BB Player already owns an eTicket for this content -
	  This is the case where the BB needs to reload the eTicket.
	  The server simply returns the eTicket with a status code
	  indicating this, and the <em>Retail App</em> proceeds to
	  store the eTicket onto the <em>BB Card</em>.  No database record will be modified.
	</li>
	<li>The transaction has completed but the eTicket
	  is not written on the <em>BB Card</em> - repeat the steps
	  for purchasing the eTicket, which brings us to the previous
	  exception case and the eTicket will be loaded again.</li>
      </ol>
