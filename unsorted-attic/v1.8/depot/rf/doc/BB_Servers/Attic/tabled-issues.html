      <p>
	Listed here are issues that should be
	revisited again after we have completed the overall design
	discussion.   Some of them already have a temporary solution,
	but they might been affected by changes in the business or user model.
      </p>

      <p>
	<font color=red>red</font>: open issues that should be
	addressed now<br>
	<font color=orange>orange</font>: decided on general
	  direction, but need to work out details<br> 
	<font color=green>green</font>: resolved.<br>

	<a name="fn1"><sup><b>1.</b></sup></a> Gift Cert:
	Two gift models have been discussed.  The preferred model is
        described first, followed by reasons why the second model is
        rejected.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gift certificates are cash-based.  They are pre-printed gift
        cards of fixed denominations.  Each gift certificate is
        imprinted with a unique ID number (or bar code, or magnetic
        stripe).  A valid gift certificate ID number should be hard to
        guess.  Gift certificates has no value until activated, at
        which point the server records the ID number, cash value, and
        the BB Depot ID in its database.  Gifts certificates should be
        activated after a shop owner collects money from the customer.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gift certificates could be used as cash for purchasing games.
        So customers should treat them as cash and we are not
        responsible for loss or illegal duplication.  To redeem a gift
        certificate, its ID number is entered into the BB Depot which
        sends it to the server for verification.  If everything
        verifies, the shop owner will be credited with the proper
        amount and the certificate ID will be voided.  The shop owner
        might need to make cash changes if the purchase amount is
        smaller than that of the gift certificate.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the record, another gift model was previously proposed.
        In that model, gift certificates are bound to a particular BB
        upon activation and can be only redeemed by it.  This model
        provides more protection for the gift recipients but is too
        inconvenient and restrictive for the gift senders.  First,
        many people like to purchase multiple gifts before deciding to
        whom they would send them.  Second, it requires our customers
        to broadcast their user names to all potential gift senders.
