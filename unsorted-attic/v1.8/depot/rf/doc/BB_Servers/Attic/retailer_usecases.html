      <h2> Terminology and Requirements</h2>
      <h3> Roles</h3>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Retailer</strong> - Store owner who has signed up
	  to sell BB, eTickets and BB Player accessories. Typically
	  will have little or no computer experience.
	</li>
	<li><strong>Service Technician</strong> - Trained personnel
	  sent to the stores to set up or service a BB Depot.
	</li>
	<li><strong>Operation Center</strong> - Responsible for
	  maintaining all BB Depots in good operating condition.
	</li>
      </ol>
      <h3> BB Depot&nbsp;</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>BB Depot - computer used by the retailer (&amp; indirectly by customer) for
          conducting BB transactions</li>
        <li>DepotID - hardware token used to identify and authenticate
	  the shop owner to the Servers.</li>
	<li>serviceID - hardware token used to identify a service
	  technician to the operation center.</li>
        <li>HardwareID - identity used to authenticate the BB Depot to the RMS
          &amp; the CDS which do not require the DepotID to be present.</li>
	<li>storeID - identifies the shop where the BB Depot resides.
	  Each BB Depot can belong to exactly one store.  StoreIDs are
	strings of digits with checksum to minimize mistyping.</li>

        <li>BB Depot USB ports - at least 4 ports with sufficient power for
          DepotID plug-in, Download Station connection, BB

      <h3>Operation Center</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Servers - refers to the transactional systems at the Ops Center. The
          Servers must always authenticate themselves to the BB Depot or BB
          Player if involved in any transaction.</li>

          the DepotID for BB Depot authentication</li>

      </h3> 
      
      <h4>Description</h4>
      A retailer requests for a new DepotID.

      <h4>Rationale</h4>
      <ol>
	<li>The DepotID is used to identify a Retailer's (bank)
	  account with which all cash transactions are carried out.
	  Thus we need to bind each DepotID to a Retailer's account
	  (via the store, i.e, DepotID -&gt; storeID -&gt; retailer).
	</li>
      </ol>

      <h4>Requirements</h4>
      <ol>
	<li>This procedure must be carried out within the secure
	  environment of the operation center (or trusted customer
	  support site).
	</li>
      </ol>

      <h4>Assumptions and conditions</h4>
      <ol>
	<li>The Retailer has already entered a business relationship
	  with us and has registered with our system.
	</li>
	<li>The Retailer has already opened a line of credit account
	  with one of our authorized bank through which our
	  transaction subsystem can debit/credit money. 
	</li>

      <h3><span style="background-color: #C0C0C0">Install New BB Depot</span></h3>
      <h4>Description</h4>
      <p>Service Technician installs a new BB Depot at retailer's site.</p>
      
      <h4>Rationale</h4>
      <ol>
	<li>Average retailers do not have enough knowledge to install
	  a new machine.</li>
	<li>Only authorized service technicians are allowed to perform
	  certain configuration operations.</li>
      </ol>

      <h4>Assumptions and conditions</h4>
      <ol>
	<li>A dedicated broadband Internet access has already been
	  setup at retailer's site.</li>
	<li>Basic network parameters (static or dynamic IP address,
	  default gateway, DNS server, etc.) have already been
	  obtained from ISP.
	</li>
	<li>Retailer has already opened an account with our system.</li>
	<li>The Retailer may or may not have obtained a DepotID.</li>
	<li>This store has already been assigned to a region.</li>
	<li>The service technician knows the storeID for this store.</li>
	<li>The "master" operation center will always have all the
	  database information.  This includes the relationship
	  between DepotID and storeID.</li>
      </ol>

      <h4>Sequence of events/actions</h4>

      All operations are performed by the service technician at the
      retailer's site:
      <ol>
	<li>Set up the Depot hardware:  connect the power supply,
	  network, and download station.</li>
	<li>Insert the serviceID into a USB port of the Depot
	  Console.  This brings up the Installer Apps.</li>
	<li>Select network configuration, and enter all necessary
	  network parameters (the installer apps should verify network
	  connectivity automatically).</li>
	<li>Select depot configuration, enter the storeID when
	  prompted.</li>
	<li>The hardwareID, as well as depot configuration parameters
	  such as the URLs of the RMS, CDS, and transaction servers
	  would be installed automatically.</li>
	<li>Run standard configuration tests, which use the serviceID
	  as the Depot's identification token and carry out test
	  transactions against a dummy account.</li>
	<li>Following the instruction of installer app, verify all
	  major hardware components are working.  This includes the
	  Download Station(s), all USB ports, and the Memory Card Port.</li>
	<li>Remove the serviceID.  The system should automatically
	  start the content synchronization process and software
	  upgrade if needed.</li>
      </ol>
      
      <h4>Error/Failure Conditions</h4>
      The service technicians should be trained to handle any potential
      on-site.  The most common errors are:
      <ol>
	<li>Network failure - should contact the ISP.</li>
	<li>Cannot contact any of the servers.</li>
	<li>Incorrect retailer account ID.</li>
	<li>Failed to download the hardwareID and other depot
	  configuration parameters.</li>
      </ol>

      <hr></hr>
      <h3><span style="background-color: #C0C0C0">
	  Shop owner reports lost or stolen DepotID</span></h3>
      <h4>Description</h4>
      <p>Disable an existing DepotID and issue a replacement</p>
      
      <h4>Requirements</h4>
      <ol>
	<li>This procedure must be carried out within the secure
	  environment of the operation center (or trusted customer
	  support site).
	</li>
	<li>To minimize loss of the shop owner, all online transaction
	  from this DepotID must be stopped immediately.</li>
      </ol>

      <h4>Assumptions and conditions</h4>
      <ol>
	<li>The retailer has been issued a valid DepotID</li>
	<li>The retailer reports (via phone, fax, etc.) that the
	  specified DepotID has been lost.</li>
	<li>The validity of this report has been verified.</li>
      </ol>

	  <td>
	    <ol start=2>
	      <li>Operator verifies the identity of the retailer via
		other means (e.g., photo ID, matching private
		information on file, etc.)
	      </li>
	      <li>Operator locates the record of this DepotID and marks
		it as revoked.  Once this information is entered, all
		transaction servers would immediately reject
		connection from this DepotID.</li>
	      <li>Operator issues a new DepotID following the
		procedure specified in "New DepotID Registration".
	      </li>
	      <li>Gives the new DepotID to the retailer if s/he shows
		up in person.  Otherwise, arrange for delivery or pick
		up separately.
	      </li>
	    </ol>
	  </td>
	</tr>
      </table>

      <h4>Error/Failure Conditions</h4>

      The operation center staff might need to locate the DepotID
      record via varies way, based on the retailer's name, account
      number, storeID, store's street address, etc.  In case a store
      has multiple BB Depots and it cannot be determined which of the
      DepotIDs is lost, we might need to revoked and reissued all of them.

      <h3><span style="background-color: #C0C0C0">Replace hard disk on
	BB Depot</span></h3>

      <h4>Description</h4>
      The only serviceable parts of a BB Depot console is the hard
      disk.  If the hard disk fails, it needs to be replaced by a
      service technician.

      <h4>Assumptions and conditions</h4>
      <ol>
	<li>Service technician has verified that the network is
	  functioning correctly and that the problem lies in the BB Depot.</li>
	<li>Service technician has already determined that the BB
	  Depot is not functioning properly and replacing the hard
	  disk might be a solution.</li>
	<li>Service technician has carried with him a spare hard disk
	  that has already been initialized with the same information
	  put in at the Depot manufacturing site.
      </ol>

      <h4>Sequence of events/actions</h4>
      All of the following steps are carried out by the service technician:
      <ol>
	<li>replace the hard disk</li>
	<li>insert the seviceID</li>
	<li>verify that the hard disk is "clean", if not, reset it to
	  factory default (i.e., erase all configuration data).
	</li>
	<li>following the normal installation procedure to set up the
	  network parameters, depot configuration parameters, and
	  download a new hardwareID.</li>
	<li>verify that the Depot is now operational.</li>
      </ol>

      <h4>Error/Failure Conditions</h4>

      If any of the above steps does not work, there are other
      hardware failures beyond the hard disk.  Send the Depot back for
      service.
