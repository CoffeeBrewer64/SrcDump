      </ol>

      <h3>Sequence of events</h3>
      <ol>
	<li><code>authenticate</code>
	  <ol type=a>
	    <li><em>Retail App</em> connects to <em>BB Activation Server</em></li>
	    <li>mutually verifies each other's identity</li>
	    <li>establishes secure communication link</li>
	  </ol>
	</li>
	<li><code>readID</code>
	  <ol type=a>
	    <li><em>Retail App</em> asks the <em>Reinit Server</em> for
	      its <code>BB_ID</code></li>
	  </ol>
	</li>
	<li><code>activate</code>
	  <ol type=a>
	    <li><em>Retail App</em> requests for BB Activation, passing
	      along the <code>BB_ID</code> (The <code>DepotID</code>
	      has already passed to the Server as a side-effect of the
	      authentication step.)</li> 
	    <li><em>BB Activation Server</em> verifies that the BB
	      Player has been registered but not activated.</li>
	  </ol>
	</li>
	<li><code>authenticate</code>
	  <ol type=a>
	    <li><em>BB Activation Server</em> authenticates the BB
	      Player by asking the <em>Reinit Server</em> to digitally
	      sign (i.e., encrypt by BB's private key) a random message.</li>
	    <li>Verifies the signature using the BB's public key as
	      shown in the BB Record.</li> 
	  </ol>
	</li>
	<li><code>approveActivation</code>
	  <ol type=a>
	    <li><em>BB Activation Server</em> updates the <code>state</code>,
	      <code>RegionalID</code>, <code>date</code>, and
	      <code>DepotID</code> fields of the BB record.</li>
	    <li>Sends a return status and the digital certificate back
	      to the <em>Retail App</em>.</li>
	  </ol>
	  Note: The entire transaction is considered complete once
	  the BB Record is updated.  This operation must be atomic.
	</li>
	<li><code>soldBB</code>
	  <ol type=a>
	    <li>This is a <em>deferred transaction</em> triggered by
	      the completion of the BB activation transaction.</li>
	    <li>Notifies the <em>Inventory Server</em> that the
	      specified BB Player has been activated by that
	      particular store.</li>
	  </ol>
	</li>
	<li><code>writeCert</code>
	  <ol type=a>
	    <li><em>Retail App</em> receives the digital cert., and
	      passes it along to the <em>Reinit Server</em> to be
	      stored into the BB Card</li>
	    <li>Indicates to the operator that the transaction has completed.</li>
	  </ol>
      </ol>
      <h3>Post-conditions</h3>
      <ol>
	<li>The BB Record indicates this BB Player is now
	  activated.</li>
	<li>The BB Card contains the digital cert.</li>
	<li>(<em>Deferred</em>) The inventory database is updated with
	  this sale.</li>
      </ol>
      
      <h3>Audit Records</h3>
      <ol>
	<li>Activation Request - <code>DepotID</code>,
	  <code>BB_ID</code>, <code>date</code>, approval status.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3><a name="exception">Exceptions</a></h3>

      <ol>
	<li>Secure connection cannot be established - the <em>Retail
	    App</em> needs to provide reason(s) of failure.</li>
	<li>The activation request is not approved. In this case, only
	  the status code will be returned by the <em>BB Activation Server</em>:
	  <ol type=a>
	    <li><code>BB_ID</code> not registered, or it has been
	      suspended or retired.</li>
	    <li>The BB Depot is black listed.</li>
	    <li>BB Player fails to authenticate itself.</li>
	    <li>Internal server error, e.g., database failure, backend
	      server crashed, etc.</li>
	  </ol>
	</li>
	<li>The BB Player has already activated - This is the case
	  when a activated BB needs to reload its cert.  The server
	  simply returns the corresponding cert.  The state of the BB
	  is not change, and no inventory record is modified.
	</li>
	<li>Transaction has been completed (i.e., BB Record updated)
	  but the digital certificate fails to be written to the BB
	  Card - The BB Player is still considered sold, but the cert
	  could be reloaded by repeating the activation process.</li>
      </ol>
