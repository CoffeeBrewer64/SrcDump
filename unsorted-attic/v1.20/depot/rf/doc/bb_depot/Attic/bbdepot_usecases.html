	<ol>
	    <li>The customer experience must be smooth and we must adhere to

	    <li>It must be possible to sell BB Players at stores without any BB

          BB Card in one package. This BB Card contains any <i>Free Content</i>
          along with the eTicket to play it.&nbsp;</li>
        <li>It must be possible to create <i>Value Packs</i> for customers where
          we bundle in multiple content pieces with the associated eTickets to

          the store to incur any additional cost in terms of purchase or
          download steps.&nbsp;</li>
