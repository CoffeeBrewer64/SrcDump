Mass Reverse is a mass video game reversing project for Nintendo, Sony and Microsoft consoles led by CoffeeBrewer64.

Mass Reverse simply runs games through popular reverse engineering tools (mainly Ghidra by the National Security Agency [NSA]) and shares the output.

We have opted for C/C++ files in a lot of scenarios, even if the game was not made in C/C++.

For example, if the game was made in Assembly (ASM), because ASM does not have proper variable names, variable names will not be a thing in the outputted code.
